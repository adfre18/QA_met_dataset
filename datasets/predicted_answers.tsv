James B. Longacre	Question: question: What was Longacre the fourth Chief Engraver of?	Ref: Mint	Pred: United States Mint	Context: James Barton Longacre (August 11, 1794 – January 1, 1869) was an American portraitist and engraver, and the fourth Chief Engraver of the United States Mint from 1844 until his death. Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century.Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm. He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844.In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre. Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained.  Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict.In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece. In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber. Longacre's coins are generally well-regarded today, although they have been criticized for lack of artistic advancement.
Christian Gobrecht	Question: question: What coin was inspired by the Gobrecht Dollar?	Ref: Eagle	Pred: Flying Eagle cent	Context: Christian Gobrecht (December 23, 1785 – July 23, 1844) was the third Chief Engraver of the United States Mint from 1840 until his death in 1844. He was responsible for designing the famous "Seated Liberty" designs, which were in turn the direct inspiration for the design of the Trade Dollar. He designed the Gobrecht Dollar, which was struck in small quantities from 1836 to 1838 and later inspired the Flying Eagle cent. He also designed the obverse sides for the Liberty head (aka Coronet Head) Quarter Eagle, Half Eagle, and Eagle gold coins, as well as the "braided hair" type Half cent and Large cent coins.
Bela Pratt	Question: question: Who was the father of the first music school in the country?	Ref: Pratt	Pred: Oramel Whittlesey	Context: Bela Lyon Pratt (December 11, 1867 – May 18, 1917) was an American sculptor from Connecticut. Pratt was born in Norwich, Connecticut, to Sarah (Whittlesey) and George Pratt, a Yale-educated lawyer. His maternal grandfather, Oramel Whittlesey, was a pianoforte maker and founder in 1835 of Music Vale Seminary in Salem, Connecticut, the first music school in the country authorized to confer degrees to teach music. At 16, Pratt began studying at the Yale University School of Fine Arts, where his teachers included John Henry Niemeyer (1839–1932) and John Ferguson Weir (1841–1926).After graduating from Yale, he enrolled at the Art Students League of New York where he took classes from William Merritt Chase (1849–1916), Kenyon Cox (1859–1919), Francis Edwin Elwell (1858–1922), and most important, Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848–1907), who became his mentor. After a short stint in Saint-Gaudens' private studio, Pratt traveled to Paris, where he trained with sculptors Henri-Michel-Antoine Chapu (1833–1891) and Alexandre Falguière (1831–1900) at the École des Beaux-Arts.In 1892, he returned to the United States to create two large sculptural groups representing The Genius of Navigation for the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. He also produced sculptures for the Pan-American Exposition at Buffalo in 1901.  In 1893, he began a 25-year career as an influential teacher of modeling in the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. One of Pratt's most famous students at the School was John A. Wilson. During this time, Pratt sculpted a series of busts of Boston's intellectual community, including Episcopal minister Phillips Brooks (1899, Brooks House, Harvard University), Colonel Henry Lee (1902, Memorial Hall, Harvard University), and Boston Symphony Orchestra founder Henry Lee Higginson (1909, Symphony Hall, Boston).  He became an associate of the National Academy in 1900.  (1)When Saint-Gaudens' uncompleted group for the entrance to the Boston Public Library was rejected, Pratt was awarded a commission for personifications of Art and Science. Pratt continued Saint-Gaudens' influence in coin design after 1907. His gold Indian Head half ($5) and quarter ($2.50) eagle gold U.S. coins are known as the "Pratt coins" and feature an unusual intaglio Indian head, the U.S. mint's only recessed design in circulation. A memorial exhibition of 125 of his sculptures was held at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in the spring of 1918.Pratt's students included Frederick Warren Allen, Daisy Blanche King., Bashka Paeff, and Richard Henry Recchia, as well as his son Dudley Pratt.

Paul Revere	Question: question: What war was Paul Revere credited with leading?	Ref: American Revolutionary War	Pred: American Revolutionary War	Context: Paul Revere (; December 21, 1734 O.S. (January 1, 1735 N.S.) – May 10, 1818) was an American silversmith, engraver, early industrialist, Sons of Liberty member, and Patriot and Founding Father. He is best known for his midnight ride to alert the colonial militia in April 1775 to the approach of British forces before the battles of Lexington and Concord, as dramatized in Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1861 poem, "Paul Revere's Ride".At age 41, Revere was a prosperous, established and prominent Boston silversmith. He had helped organize an intelligence and alarm system to keep watch on the British military. Revere later served as a Massachusetts militia officer, though his service ended after the Penobscot Expedition, one of the most disastrous campaigns of the American Revolutionary War, for which he was absolved of blame.Following the war, Revere returned to his silversmith trade. He used the profits from his expanding business to finance his work in iron casting, bronze bell and cannon casting, and the forging of copper bolts and spikes. In 1800, he became the first American to successfully roll copper into sheets for use as sheathing on naval vessels.
Stanford White	Question: question: What firm was Stanford White a partner in?	Ref: McKim	Pred: McKim, Mead & White	Context: Stanford White (November 9, 1853 – June 25, 1906) was an American architect. He was also a partner in the architectural firm McKim, Mead & White, one of the most significant Beaux-Arts firms. He designed many houses for the rich, in addition to numerous civic, institutional, and religious buildings. His temporary Washington Square Arch was so popular that he was commissioned to design a permanent one. His design principles embodied the "American Renaissance".In 1906, White was shot and killed at the Madison Square Theatre by Harry Kendall Thaw, in front of a large audience during a musical theatre performance. Thaw was a wealthy but mentally unstable heir of a coal and railroad fortune who had become obsessed by White's alleged drugging, rape and subsequent relationship with his wife Evelyn Nesbit, which started when she was 16, four years before their marriage. She had married Thaw in 1905 and was a famous fashion model who was performing as an actress in the show. With the elements of a sex scandal among the wealthy and the public killing, the resulting sensational trial of Thaw was dubbed "The Trial of the Century" by contemporary reporters. Thaw was ultimately found not guilty by reason of insanity.

Shakers	Question: question: Where were the Shakers founded?	Ref: England	Pred: England	Context: The United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing, more commonly known as the Shakers, are a millenarian restorationist Christian sect founded c. 1747 in England and then organized in the United States in the 1780s. They were initially known as "Shaking Quakers" because of their ecstatic behavior during worship services. Espousing egalitarian ideals, women took on spiritual leadership roles alongside men, including founding leaders such as Jane Wardley, Ann Lee, and Lucy Wright. The Shakers emigrated from England and settled in Revolutionary colonial America, with an initial settlement at Watervliet, New York (present-day Colonie), in 1774. They practice a celibate and communal utopian lifestyle, pacifism, uniform charismatic worship, and their model of equality of the sexes, which they institutionalized in their society in the 1780s. They are also known for their simple living, architecture, technological innovation, music, and furniture.During the mid-19th century, an Era of Manifestations resulted in a period of dances, gift drawings, and gift songs inspired by spiritual revelations. At its peak in the mid-19th century, there were 2,000–4,000 Shaker believers living in 18 major communities and numerous smaller, often short-lived communities. External and internal societal changes in the mid- and late-19th century resulted in the thinning of the Shaker community as members left or died with few converts to the faith to replace them. By 1920, there were only 12 Shaker communities remaining in the United States. As of 2019, there is only one active Shaker village: Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village, in Maine. Consequently, many of the other Shaker settlements are now museums.
John Singer Sargent	Question: question: Where was John Singer Sargent born?	Ref: Florence	Pred: Florenci	Context: John Singer Sargent (; January 12, 1856 – April 14, 1925) was an American expatriate artist, considered the "leading portrait painter of his generation" for his evocations of Edwardian-era luxury. He created roughly 900 oil paintings and more than 2,000 watercolors, as well as countless sketches and charcoal drawings. His oeuvre documents worldwide travel, from Venice to the Tyrol, Corfu, Spain, the Middle East, Montana, Maine, and Florida.Born in Florence to American parents, he was trained in Paris before moving to London, living most of his life in Europe. He enjoyed international acclaim as a portrait painter. An early submission to the Paris Salon in the 1880s, his Portrait of Madame X, was intended to consolidate his position as a society painter in Paris, but instead resulted in scandal. During the next year following the scandal, Sargent departed for England where he continued a successful career as a portrait artist.From the beginning, Sargent's work is characterized by remarkable technical facility, particularly in his ability to draw with a brush, which in later years inspired admiration as well as criticism for a supposed superficiality. His commissioned works were consistent with the grand manner of portraiture, while his informal studies and landscape paintings displayed a familiarity with Impressionism. In later life Sargent expressed ambivalence about the restrictions of formal portrait work, and devoted much of his energy to mural painting and working en plein air. Art historians generally ignored society artists such as Sargent until the late 20th century.The exhibition in the 1980s of Sargent's previously hidden male nudes served to spark a re-evaluation of his life and work, and its psychological complexity. In addition to the beauty, sensation, and innovation of his oeuvre, his same-sex interests, unconventional friendships with women, and engagement with race, gender-nonconformity and emerging globalism, are now viewed as socially and aesthetically progressive, and radical.

Thomas Affleck	Question: question: What type of furniture did Thomas Affleck specialize in?	Ref: pendale	Pred: Philadelphia Chippendale style	Context: Thomas Affleck (1740–1795) was an 18th-century American cabinetmaker, who specialized in furniture in the Philadelphia Chippendale style. He was born in Aberdeen, Scotland to a devout Quaker family. There is no documentation of where he learned his trade, but, based on stylistic similarities to his later work, it is conjectured that he apprenticed under Edinburgh cabinetmaker Alexander Peter. He moved to London in 1760, and immigrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1763. That same year, John Penn, a grandson of Pennsylvania's founder William Penn, arrived in Philadelphia and was sworn in as governor of the Colony. One of Affleck's first major commissions came in 1766 for a substantial set of furniture for Governor John Penn and his bride, Anne Allen, daughter of William Allen, the Colony's richest resident.Affleck's first shop was on Union (now Delancey) Street. By 1768 he had moved to Second Street, south of Dock Creek. In 1771 he married Isabella Gordon, and was censured by his fellow Quakers for marrying "out of Meeting." The couple had six children, four of whom survived to adulthood. Isabella died in 1782, and he never remarried.Another major commission was for furnishing the Second Street city house of John and Elizabeth Cadwalader. For this Affleck was joined by fellow cabinetmaker Benjamin Randolph, and carvers Hercules Courtenay, John Pollard, Nicholas Bernard, and Martin Jugiez. Cadwalader's receipts for the work survive at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, although determining which cabinetmaker made which piece (and which carver carved which) sometimes must be based on attribution.He participated in 1776 protests against war with Great Britain, but it is unclear whether he was a Loyalist, a pacifist, or both. He was deemed a "dangerous person"—along with a number of his fellow Quakers—in August 1777, and banished to Virginia in October. Seven months later he was allowed to return to Philadelphia. He did not fight in the American Revolutionary War on either side.Merchant Levi Hollingsworth was a patron and friend of Affleck's. A suite of furniture with identically carved legs – twin high chests, matching twin dressing tables, a set of 8 chairs, twin pie-crust tea tables – descended in the Hollingsworth family. During the war, Affleck sometimes traded furniture to Hollingsworth for materials and other goods. One of the pie-crust tea tables was traded to Hollingsworth for a 7-gallon cask of rum.He moved his shop to Elmslie's Court in 1791. In 1790 Philadelphia became the temporary national capital for a 10-year period, while Washington, D.C. was under construction. Affleck may have made the chairs in Congress Hall for the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate.Affleck died in 1795. His eldest son, Lewis, continued as a cabinetmaker.

Frank Lloyd Wright	Question: question: What is the name of the World Heritage Site that Wright designed?	Ref: The 20th-Century Architecture	Pred: The 20th Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright	Context: Frank Lloyd Wright (June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) was an American architect, designer, writer, and educator. He designed more than 1,000 structures over a creative period of 70 years. Wright played a key role in the architectural movements of the twentieth century, influencing architects worldwide through his works and hundreds of apprentices in his Taliesin Fellowship. Wright believed in designing in harmony with humanity and the environment, a philosophy he called organic architecture. This philosophy was exemplified in Fallingwater (1935), which has been called "the best all-time work of American architecture".Wright was the pioneer of what came to be called the Prairie School movement of architecture and also developed the concept of the Usonian home in Broadacre City, his vision for urban planning in the United States. He also designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and other commercial projects. Wright-designed interior elements (including leaded glass windows, floors, furniture and even tableware) were integrated into these structures. He wrote several books and numerous articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as "the greatest American architect of all time". In 2019, a selection of his work became a listed World Heritage Site as The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright.Raised in rural Wisconsin, Wright studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin and then apprenticed in Chicago, briefly with Joseph Lyman Silsbee, and then with Louis Sullivan at Adler & Sullivan.  Wright opened his own successful Chicago practice in 1893 and established a studio in his Oak Park, Illinois home in 1898. His fame increased and his personal life sometimes made headlines: leaving his first wife Catherine Tobin for Mamah Cheney  in 1909; the murder of Mamah and her children and others at his Taliesin estate by a staff member in 1914; his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel (m. 1923–1927); and his courtship and marriage with Olgivanna Lazović (m. 1928–1959).

Ref: The Albany Gazette	Pred: The Albany Gazette	Context: Isaac Hutton (before July 20, 1766 –  8 Sep 1855) was an American silversmith and engraver, active in Albany, New York.Hutton was born in New York City to George and Anna Viele Hutton, and on July 20, 1766, was baptized into the Dutch Reformed Church. He moved to Albany in the 1780s, where he was probably apprenticed to silversmith John Folsom, with whom he partnered from 1787 to 1790 as FOLSOM & HUTTON. In 1791 he purchased property for his house and shop at 32 Market Street. In 1794 he engraved the Plan of the City of Albany, and in 1798 profiles of members of the House of Assembly. From February 1796 to 1817 he was in partnership with his brother, George Hutton, as I & G HUTTON, and on September 30, 1796, advertised in The Albany Gazette: "Three Silver Smiths, May have constant employ in a very convienent [sic] shop, and recieve [sic] prompt pay, by application immediately to I. & G. HUTTON, No 32, Market Street." They created the seal for Union College, in Schenectady, New York, for which they were paid in November 1796. During the War of 1812, the Huttons sold silver and other items for military use, including silver accoutrements and fittings, gunpowder, regimental drums, and even pianofortes, and sheep wool.Hutton was an active citizen in Albany. In 1791 he was a member of a fire company, in 1793 was a founding member and treasurer of Albany Mechanics Society, in 1811 served as a founding director of the Mechanics & Farmers Bank, and in 1813 was named president of the bank's board, in which he served until 1817. He was also a director of the Albany Water Works and a founder of the Albany Female Academy. Hutton went bankrupt in 1817 due to speculation in a venture to manufacture cotton goods, and left Albany after a sheriff's sale in 1819. He was listed in census records in 1850 and 1855 as a resident of Stuyvesant, New York, and died in Stuyvesant Landing.His work is collected in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York State Museum, Albany Institute of History and Art, and the Clark Art Institute.

Wedgwood	Question: question: What language is Wedgwood?	Ref: English	Pred: English	Context: Wedgwood is an English fine china, porcelain and luxury accessories manufacturer that was founded on 1 May 1759 by the potter and entrepreneur Josiah Wedgwood and was first incorporated in 1895 as Josiah Wedgwood and Sons Ltd.  It was rapidly successful and was soon one of the largest manufacturers of Staffordshire pottery, "a firm that has done more to spread the knowledge and enhance the reputation of British ceramic art than any other manufacturer", exporting across Europe as far as Russia, and to the Americas.  It was especially successful at producing fine earthenware and stoneware that were accepted as equivalent in quality to porcelain (which Wedgwood only made later) but were considerably cheaper.Wedgwood is especially associated with the "dry-bodied" (unglazed) stoneware Jasperware in contrasting colours, and in particular that in "Wedgwood blue" and white, always much the most popular colours, though there are several others. Jasperware has been made continuously by the firm since 1775, and also much imitated.  In the 18th century, however, it was table china in the refined earthenware creamware that represented most of the sales and profits.In the later 19th century, it returned to being a leader in design and technical innovation, as well as continuing to make many of the older styles.  Despite increasing local competition in its export markets, the business continued to flourish in the 19th and early 20th centuries, remaining in the hands of the Wedgwood family, but after World War II it began to contract, along with the rest of the English pottery industry.After buying a number of other Staffordshire ceramics companies, in 1987 Wedgwood merged with Waterford Crystal to create Waterford Wedgwood plc, an Ireland-based luxury brands group.  After a 2009 purchase by KPS Capital Partners, a New York-based private equity firm, the group became known as WWRD Holdings Limited, an initialism for "Waterford Wedgwood Royal Doulton".  This was acquired in July 2015 by Fiskars, a Finnish consumer goods company.

Tiffany Studios	Question: question: Along with Agnes F. Northrop and Frederick Wilson, who was a Tiffany designer?	Ref: Clara Driscoll	Pred: Clara Driscoll	Context: Tiffany glass refers to the many and varied types of glass developed and produced from 1878 to 1933 at the Tiffany Studios in New York City, by Louis Comfort Tiffany and a team of other designers, including Clara Driscoll, Agnes F. Northrop, and Frederick Wilson.In 1865, Tiffany traveled to Europe, and in London he visited the Victoria and Albert Museum, whose extensive collection of Roman and Syrian glass made a deep impression on him. He admired the coloration of medieval glass and was convinced that the quality of contemporary glass could be improved upon. In his own words, the "Rich tones are due in part to the use of pot metal full of impurities, and in part to the uneven thickness of the glass, but still more because the glass maker of that day abstained from the use of paint".Tiffany was an interior designer, and in 1878 his interest turned toward the creation of stained glass, when he opened his own studio and glass foundry because he was unable to find the types of glass that he desired in interior decoration. His inventiveness both as a designer of windows and as a producer of the material with which to create them was to become renowned.  Tiffany wanted the glass itself to transmit texture and rich colors and he developed a type of glass he called "Favrile".The glass was manufactured at the Tiffany factory located at 96-18 43rd Avenue in the Corona section of Queens from 1901 to 1932.

Gorham Manufacturing Company	Question: question: What nationality is Gorham Manufacturing Company?	Ref: American	Pred: American	Context: The Gorham Manufacturing Company is one of the largest American manufacturers of sterling and silverplate and a foundry for bronze sculpture. Gorham Silver was founded in Providence, Rhode Island, 1831 by Jabez Gorham, a master craftsman, in partnership with Henry L. Webster.  The firm's chief product was spoons of coin silver. The company also made thimbles, combs, jewelry, and other small items. In  1842, the Congress enacted a tariff which effectively blocked the importation of silverware from outside the United States, which aided the American silver industry. Jabez Gorham did not take full advantage of this opportunity, but in 1847 Jabez retired and his son, John Gorham succeeded him as head of the company.John Gorham introduced mechanized production methods, enlarged the premises in downtown Providence, improved the designs, and expanded the product line. In 1852, Gorham toured many of Europe's silver workshops and manufacturers, speaking with individual specialists, including master craftsmen and toolmakers. He sought highly skilled foreign workmen to train his American workers and hired George Wilkinson, a premier designer and workshop manager, from England. In 1865, the Rhode Island legislature granted a charter in the name of Gorham Manufacturing Company and in 1890, the company relocated to a factory on Adelaide Avenue in Providence.During the heyday of American silver manufacturing, approximately 1850–1940, Gorham was highly influential. William Christmas Codman, one of Gorham's most noted designers, created the Chantilly design in 1895, which has become the most famous of Gorham's flatware patterns. The company has produced matching hollowware in both sterling and silverplate.In 1884, the company opened a store in the Ladies' Mile shopping district in Manhattan, New York City, but moved in 1905 to a Fifth Avenue building which it commissioned from architect Stanford White.  In 1906, Gorham purchased another long-time rival, New Jersey-based Kerr & Co. In 1924, the company absorbed the Massachusetts jewelry company Whiting Manufacturing Company, founded by William Dean Whiting in 1866.Textron purchased the company in 1967, a move that some critics claim decreased quality due to management's lack of understanding of Gorham's specialty, producing high-quality sterling silverware and holloware.  Textron began planning to sell the unit in 1988, completing the sale in 1989 to Dansk International Designs.  Brown-Forman Corporation acquired Gorham from Dansk in 1991. The unit was sold in 2005 to Department 56 in the Lenox holdings transaction, with the resulting company renamed as Lenox Group. However, in 2009 Lenox Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and it was subsequently acquired by Clarion Capital Partners, now operating under the name Lenox Corporation, which has three operating divisions, Lenox, Dansk, and Gorham.
Union Porcelain Works	Question: question: Who was the first American to make true porcelain?	Ref: Thomas C. Smith	Pred: Smith	Context: The Union Porcelain Works was both the first and the foremost American manufacturer of porcelain wares from c. 1862 to c. 1922, with its factory located in Greenpoint, now a part of Brooklyn, New York.The company's history traces back to c. 1844 when William Boch & Brothers began to make soft-paste porcelain (a mixture of kaolin and phosphate of lime, after an English formula) in a single kiln. By 1850 their enterprise was organized under several names including the Union Porcelain Works and Empire Porcelain Works. The brothers proved unsuccessful, and their factory passed into the hands of a stock company, who succeeded in inducing Thomas Carll Smith (1815–1901), then a prosperous architect and builder in New York, to loan them considerable sums of money in 1859. The war came on, the company failed, and in 1862 Smith found himself obliged to take the factory for his debt.In 1863, Smith visited the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres in France and English potteries in Stoke-on-Trent, during which visit he became determined to switch to the manufacture of hard-paste porcelain. He thus became the first American to make true porcelain. He reworked the factory tools accordingly at a cost of $250,000, and purchased a quarry in Branchville, Connecticut, to supply the necessary quartz and feldspar. After two years of experiment, he began to sell a small quantity of his porcelain.From 1864 to 1869, the firm was known as Thomas C. Smith and Company, but the factory itself continued to be called the Union Porcelain Works. In its first decade, its products were limited to sturdy white china plates and dishes for the hotel trade, electrical insulators, hardware trimming, and decorated tiles. However, in 1874, in preparation for the Centennial Exposition, Smith hired sculptor Karl L. H. Müller (c. 1820–1887) as the company's chief designer. Mueller then created a wide range of designs for porcelain pieces, most notably the Century Vase which was exhibited at the Centennial Exposition. John Mackie Falconer also created designs for the company.By 1917, the firm employed more than 200 persons in a factory nearly the size of a city block. Its kilns were huge cylindrical structures, 15 feet in diameter, and 20 feet in height, with brick walls more than 3 feet thick. When fired, a kiln used about 10 tons of coal for one firing, with combustion continued for 30 to 35 hours. About 30,000 to 60,000 pieces of ware were included in one firing.The company appears to have ceased operations in 1922.

Matthew Boulton	Question: question: Who did Boulton lobby to extend Watt's patent?	Ref: Parliament	Pred: Parliament	Context: Matthew Boulton  ( (listen) BOHL-tən; 3 September 1728 – 17 August 1809) was an English manufacturer and business partner of Scottish engineer James Watt.  In the final quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines, which were a great advance on the state of the art, making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills.  Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date equipment.Born in Birmingham, he was the son of a Birmingham manufacturer of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31.  By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and thereafter expanded it considerably, consolidating operations at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham.  At Soho, he adopted the latest techniques, branching into silver plate, ormolu and other decorative arts. He became associated with James Watt when Watt's business partner, John Roebuck, was unable to pay a debt to Boulton, who accepted Roebuck's share of Watt's patent as settlement. He then successfully lobbied Parliament to extend Watt's patent for an additional 17 years, enabling the firm to market Watt's steam engine. The firm installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines in Britain and abroad, initially in mines and then in factories.Boulton was a key member of the Lunar Society, a group of Birmingham-area men prominent in the arts, sciences, and theology.  Members included Watt, Erasmus Darwin, Josiah Wedgwood and Joseph Priestley.  The Society met each month near the full moon.  Members of the Society have been given credit for developing concepts and techniques in science, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, and transport that laid the groundwork for the Industrial Revolution.Boulton founded the Soho Mint, to which he soon adapted steam power.  He sought to improve the poor state of Britain's coinage, and after several years of effort obtained a contract in 1797 to produce the first British copper coinage in a quarter century.  His "cartwheel" pieces were well-designed and difficult to counterfeit, and included the first striking of the large copper British penny, which continued to be coined until decimalisation in 1971.  He retired in 1800, though continuing to run his mint, and died in 1809.  His image appears alongside his partner James Watt on the Bank of England's current Series F £50 note.

Michael Allison	Question: question: What was the name of Michael Allison's music?	Ref: Ambient	Pred: Darshan Ambient	Context: Michael Allison (August 7, 1958 – January 9, 2020), who recorded under the name Darshan Ambient, was an American musician and vocalist known for his ambient electronic music. Allison attended high school in Modesto, California, and in his mid-teens became lead singer of a rock band, Brimstone.  He then joined another band, Skyway, as bass player, and toured widely with them in the Pacific Northwest and the South.  When he was 18, he met musician Naux (Juan Maciel), who introduced him to the teachings of Paramahansa Yogananda.  Allison later said that: "From that time on, musically, everything I wrote was geared towards a form of Self-Realization. It became cathartic for me to make music that actually produced something positive in people."  With Naux, Allison played in New York City, in bands such as Nona Hendryx's Zero Cool, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and China Shop.  In 1984, he formed his own band, Empty House, who played at CBGB's, TRAX, and the Pyramid Club, where they became the regular house band.Allison left New York in 1987 and moved to San Francisco, where – influenced by musicians such as Brian Eno and Bill Nelson – he began to make ambient electronic music independently of major record labels.  Using the name Darshan, from a Sanskrit word meaning "divine vision", and later adding the word "Ambient" to distinguish his music from that of an existing band called Darshan, he started to record and release his own music in 1992.  His albums included Providence (2002), The Zen Master’s Diary (2002), Autumn’s Apple (2004), From Pale Hands To Weary Skies (2008), A Day Within Days (2010), and Dream In Blue (2011).  His music was used in several films, documentaries, and commercials.   He joined the Lotuspike label in 2004, and Spotted Peccary Music in 2008, releasing a total of 14 albums with the labels over that period.  A compilation of his work, Re: Karma, was released in 2005.  His 2008 album From Pale Hands To Weary Skies won Best Ambient Album at the 2008 NAR Lifestyle Music Awards. His final album, A Day Like Any Other, was released in January 2020.Allison died in 2020, aged 61, from cancer.== References ==

Ref: -German industrial	Pred: Anti-German	Context: Carlo Bugatti (2 February 1856 – April 1940) was an Italian decorator, designer and manufacturer of Art Nouveau furniture, models of jewelry, and musical instruments. Son of Giovanni Luigi Bugatti, a specialist in interior decoration, Carlo Bugatti was born 2 February 1856 in Milan, in what was until 1859 the kingdom of Lombardy. Bugatti studied firstly at the Brera Academy in Milan, and subsequently, from 1875, at the Académie des Beaux Arts in Paris. In 1880 he started to manufacture furniture in Milan, later transferring to France. From 1888 he began to be successful beyond Italy. Nevertheless, until 1904 he maintained a Milan workshop in the city's Via Castelfiardo 6.Bugatti triumphed at the exhibition of decorative art in Turin in 1902 and returned to Paris in 1904. He was also, like his father, trained as an architect, but there is no evidence that any of his architectural designs were ever executed.Father of sculptor Rembrandt Bugatti and automobile manufacturer Ettore Bugatti, he moved in 1910 to Pierrefonds where he established an atelier. From 1914 to 1918 he was nominated mayor of the village, and the outspoken anti-German industrialist Adolphe Clément-Bayard, who lived at the Domaine du Bois d'Aucourt, entrusted its upkeep to him. From then on, he devoted himself entirely to painting.After the suicide of his son Rembrandt in 1916, Bugatti, then 60, produced less, but he remained influential.In 1935, at the age of 79, he retired near his son Ettore's family in Alsace. He settled in a flat north of Château Saint-Jean, Dorlisheim, with his wife Teresa (who died shortly afterwards), at the domain of promotion of Bugatti property of his son Ettore.Carlo Bugatti spent his last months at his apartment at the Bugatti factory in Molsheim, where he frequented the workmen and the house of 'the Hardtmühle', living with Ettore and his family.In April 1940, he died at the hospital in Molsheim. He is buried in the Bugatti family cemetery at Dorlisheim. The Bugatti section of Molsheim's municipal Musée de la Chartreuse displays works and items in his remembrance.

Lambert Hitchcock	Question: question: Who was famous for designing and mass-producing the Hitchcock chair?	Ref: Hitchcock	Pred: Lambert Hitchcock	Context: Lambert Hitchcock (May 28, 1795, Cheshire, Connecticut – 1852) was an American furniture manufacturer, famous for designing and mass-producing the Hitchcock chair.Hitchcock was the son of John Lee Hitchcock, an American Revolutionary War veteran who was lost at sea in 1811.  He attended the Episcopal Academy of Cheshire, now known as Cheshire Academy, and was an apprentice to woodworker Silas Cheney.  In 1818, he opened a furniture factory in Riverton, Connecticut, then called Hitchcocksville.  The factory at first made chair parts.  Soon Hitchcock, influenced by Connecticut clockmaker Eli Terry, began mass-producing simple, affordable chairs.  Instead of painting designs on the backs, he used the relatively new and easier technique of stenciling.  By the late 1820s, the Hitchcock Chair Company was producing over 15,000 chairs a year.Although an innovative manufacturer, Hitchcock was an unsuccessful businessman.  His company went through receivership in 1832, with his brothers-in-law joining the business under the name Hitchcock, Alford & Co.  In 1843, he sold his interest in the company and started a new company in Unionville, Connecticut, which also failed.  He died in 1852 with little money to his name.In 1946, John Tarrant Kenney came upon the abandoned Hitchcock Chair factory while fishing on the Farmington River.  He wrote a biography, The Hitchcock Chair, and started a new Hitchcock Chair Company in the same location.  That business lasted until 2006, when it was forced to close due to competition from low-cost overseas furniture manufacturers. In the spring of 2010, Rick Swenson and his business partner, Gary Hath, purchased the Hitchcock name, plans, and artwork, and began producing chairs.

From 1795 to 1802 he partnered with James Howell in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as RICHARDSON & Co., from 1802 to 1810 worked solo, and ultimately sold his business to Howell.Richardson is best known for his Washington Indian Peace Medals, as he created some of the 1793 and all of the 1795 medals. This followed naturally from his earlier assistance to his father in the Friendly Association for Regaining and Preserving Peace with the Indians by Pacific Measures (founded 1755). Another notable commission was the teapot and waste bowl for which George Washington paid $44.55 in 1796.His works are collected in the Art Institute of Chicago, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and Winterthur Museum.

Chelsea porcelain factory	Question: question: What was the name of the other company that made Chelsea porcelain?	Ref: Derby	Pred: Derby	Context: Chelsea porcelain is the porcelain made by the Chelsea porcelain manufactory, the first important porcelain manufactory in England, established around 1743–45, and operating independently until 1770, when it was merged with Derby porcelain.  It made soft-paste porcelain throughout its history, though there were several changes in the "body" material and glaze used.  Its wares were aimed at a luxury market, and its site in Chelsea, London, was close to the fashionable Ranelagh Gardens pleasure ground, opened in 1742.The first known wares are the "goat and bee" cream jugs with seated goats at the base, some examples of which are incised with "Chelsea", "1745" and a triangle. The entrepreneurial director, at least from 1750, was Nicholas Sprimont, a Huguenot silversmith in Soho, but few private documents survive to aid a picture of the factory's history. Early tablewares, being produced in profusion by 1750, depend on Meissen porcelain models and on silverware prototypes, such as salt cellars in the form of realistic shells.Chelsea was known for its figures, initially mostly single standing figures of the Cries of London and other subjects. Many of these were very small by European standards, from about 21⁄2 to 31⁄2 inches (6 to 9 cm) high, overlapping with the category of "Chelsea Toys", for which the factory was famous in the 1750s and 1760s.  These were very small pieces which often had metal mounts and were functional as bonbonnières (little boxes), scent bottles, needlecases, étuis, thimbles and small seals, many with inscriptions in French, "almost invariably amorous suggestions", but often misspelled.From about 1760, its inspiration was drawn more from Sèvres porcelain than Meissen, making grand garnitures of vases and elaborate large groups with seated couples in front of a bocage screen of flowering plants, all on a raised base of Rococo scrollwork.  As with other English factories, much of the sales came from public auctions, held about once a year; copies of the catalogues for 1755, 1756 and (in part) 1761 are very useful to scholars. In 1770, the manufactory was purchased by William Duesbury, owner of the Derby porcelain factory, and the wares are indistinguishable during the "Chelsea-Derby period" that lasted until 1784, when the Chelsea factory was demolished and its moulds, patterns and many of its workmen and artists transferred to Derby.

By 1704 his apprenticeship was complete, and on May 13, 1706, he married Elizabeth Kilby. Samuel Sewall's diary records that in 1707 Cowell's shop was burgled "and a considerable quantity of Plate stolen," although the stolen silver was returned after the thief was apprehended. Seward later records, in 1715, that he hired a horse from Cowell, which is consistent with the profession of "innkeeper" recorded at Cowell's death. He is believed to have retired about 1734 when his son, William Cowell Jr., finished his apprenticeship.Cowell's work is collected in the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Art Institute of Chicago, and Yale University Art Gallery.

He was the fourth son of pewterer Johann (later John) Will, with whose family he came to New York in 1752. He served his apprenticeship in the workshop of his brother Heinrich (later Henry) in New York, before moving to Philadelphia with his brother Phillip.In 1776, despite his young age, Will was able to raise a company of infantry, and eventually rose to the rank of colonel in various regiments of the Continental Army. In 1777 he was appointed, along with Charles Wilson Peale and four others, to the 'Commission for the Seizure of the Effects of Traitors'. He subsequently served in various other public offices.Despite this extensive involvement in public life, Will was able to maintain a successful business in the manufacture and sale of pewter.During his career, Will produced an extensive variety of pewter wares, from mundane household items such as plates and tankards, to ecclesiastic pewter such as communion flagons and chalices.A primary criterion in assessing the quality of pewter is the content of the alloy. While many other American pewterers achieved a standard equal to Will's in this regard, his work is noted for its extraordinarily fine workmanship, and the ambition of his designs. He is particularly known for teapots.

However, all porcelain products sold or used in the young country were imported from Europe.In 1826, Tucker established the first hard paste porcelain factory in the United States in Philadelphia .  Tucker formed a partnership with potter Thomas Hulme in 1828 that allowed him to greatly expand production.  Even though Tucker and Hulme worked together for less than one year, there are some pieces surviving bearing their mark.In 1831, Tucker formed a second partnership with Alexander Hemphill. Tucker's died in 1832 After Tucker's death, the firm was joined by Hemphill's father (Judge Joseph Hemphill) and brother (Thomas Hemphill).  The factory continued production under the Hemphill name until it closed in 1838.The Tucker porcelains included dinner services, coffee and tea services and pitchers as well as ornamental wear such as urns and baskets. Some items were pure white and gilt, but most were hand painted and decorated with gold leaf. Surviving examples of Tucker porcelain are extremely rare and very valuable today.== References ==
Ferdinand Barbedienne	Question: question: What nationality was Ferdinand Barbedienne?	Ref: French	Pred: French	Context: Ferdinand Barbedienne (6 August 1810 – 21 March 1892) was a French metalworker and manufacturer, who was well known as a bronze founder. The son of a small farmer from Calvados, he started his career as a dealer in wallpaper in Paris. In 1838 he went into partnership with Achille Collas (1795-1859), who had just invented a machine to create miniature bronze replicas of statues. Together they started a business selling miniatures of antique statues from museums all over Europe, thus democratising art and making it more accessible to households. From 1843 they extended their scope by reproducing the work of living artists and also diversified by making enamelled household objects. With the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 the firm briefly had to switch to cannon founding owing to the shortage of metals but resumed business afterwards. Following Barbedienne's death in 1892, he was buried in the Père-Lachaise cemetery and the firm was carried on by his nephew Gustave Leblanc until 1952.Among the principal artists reproduced by the firm were Antoine Louis Barye and Auguste Rodin.

Ball Hughes was born in London. His birth year has been confirmed to be 1804 according to his baptismal record on the International Genealogical Index, and not 1806 as has been widely reported. His given name was Robert Balls Hughes according to his baptismal record.He early exhibited a decided taste for modelling, and at 12 years of age made out of wax candle ends a bas-relief copy of a picture representing the wisdom of Solomon, which was afterward cast in silver. He later studied under Edward Hodges Baily for seven years. During this time, the Royal Academy awarded him a large silver medal for the best copy in bas-relief of the Apollo Belvedere. He also received a silver medal from the Society of Arts and Sciences for a copy of the Barberini Faun, a large silver medal for the best original model from life, and a gold medal for an original composition, "Pandora brought by Mercury to Epimetheus." In 1830 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician.Hughes was commissioned to sculpt busts of various members of Britains nobility and Royal family, including the Duke of Sussex, the Duke of Cumberland and most notably King George IV. Robert Ball Hughes emigrated to New York City in 1829. His first major commission in America, was a high-relief marble memorial to Bishop John H. Hobart for Trinity Church, New York, followed by a statue of New York Governor DeWitt Clinton, and subsequently a statue of Alexander Hamilton (placed atop of the Merchants' Exchange Building New York, but destroyed by fire in 1835).  The original plaster study for that work is held by the Museum of the City of New York.After a short stay in New York, and then Philadelphia, he settled in Boston, where he produced busts of Washington Irving (1836) and Edward Livingston, and a large bronze of mathematician Nathaniel Bowditch for Mount Auburn Cemetery (1847). Ball Hughes' statue of Nathaniel Bowditch was the first large bronze to be cast in America. He made Little Nell and the group Uncle Toby and Widow Wadman, whose plaster models went to the Boston Athenaeum, but were never carved in marble. Among his later works were a model of an equestrian statue of Washington, intended for the city of Philadelphia, a Crucifixion, and a Mary Magdalen.Ball Hughes also designed numerous wax medallions, as well as coins for the United States mint, including modifications of Christian Gobrecht's design for the Seated Liberty quarter (1838), and the half dime (1859).

He also lectured on art. Hughes is buried in the Cedar Grove Cemetery, Dorchester, Massachusetts.The National Portrait Gallery contains Ball Hughes' busts of Nathaniel Bowditch, Washington Irving, James Kent, John Marshall, and his medallion of John Trumbull.

Augustin Dupré	Question: question: Where did Augustin Dupré become established?	Ref: Paris	Pred: Paris	Context: Augustin Dupré (6 October 1748 – 30 January 1833) was a French engraver of currency and medals, the 14th Graveur général des monnaies (Engraver General of Currency). He began his career as an engraver at the royal factory for weapons. Towards 1770, he became established at Paris, became the student of the sculptor David, and engraved his first medals.The French Revolution gave him the opportunity to develop his art. Because the change of regime and the monetary reform required a full change of monetary types, a competition, initiated by the painter Louis David, was opened in April 1791 by the Convention nationale. Dupré's design won and was adopted for the new currency, the "Louis conventionnel". Following this success, Dupré was named Graveur général des monnaies by decree of the Assemblée nationale on 11 July 1791. In France before the revolution there were 31 royal mints, but most of them were no more than sinecures. In 1789, there were no more than 17 mints, and Dupré wanted to have a great new mint in Paris to produce all French currency. However, the Assemblée nationale rejected his idea and retained 8 mints: Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux, Bayonne, Perpignan, Nantes, Lille, and Strasbourg. He occupied his official position until 1803, the year in which he was dismissed by a decree of the First Consul of 12 March 1803. He was replaced by Pierre-Joseph Tiolier.
Nicolas-Marie Gatteaux	Question: question: Who was the famous engraver who designed the famous crossing of the Rhine?	Ref: Moreau	Pred: Nicolas-Marie Gatteaux	Context: Nicolas-Marie Gatteaux (2 August 1751, Paris - 24 June 1832, Paris) was a French medal engraver, also notable as the father of the sculptor and medallist Jacques-Édouard Gatteaux (1788–1881). In 1781 he was appointed graveur des médailles du Roi.A student of Delorme and Gros, he designed a large number of medals, largely referring to public events, such as the death of Louis XV, the coronation of Louis XVI, the birth of the Dauphin, the invention of the hot air balloon by the Montgolfier brothers, the voyage of Lapeyrouse, the Federation of the Départements of France, the Abolition of Privileges, and Moreau's crossing of the Rhine in year VIII. Other medals designed by him shown notable figures such as Joseph Haydn, le comte de Maurepas, d'Alambert and the Three Consuls (including Bonaparte). He also designed assignats, lottery tickets and stamps.Gatteaux is also credited as the inventor of the pointing machine, a tool used for copying sculpture.Gatteaux is also well known as a playing card maker. In 1809, just after the French Revolution, Napoleon asked the famous French painter David to develop a new design of the Paris pattern. This deck was however not accepted. In 1811 Gatteaux adapted the design and it was produced until 1853. In 1813 Gatteaux made a new design which eventually became the new base Paris pattern  This continued to be the standard Paris pattern until now. The only change that was made hereafter was that it became a design with double honour cards instead of single ones.
Franklin Peale	Question: question: What is the name of the book that suggests that facts about Peale's career allow writers to draw different conclusions about him?	Ref: Numismatic	Pred: Q. David Bowers	Context: Benjamin Franklin Peale (born Aldrovand Peale; October 15, 1795 – May 5, 1870) was an employee and officer of the Philadelphia Mint from 1833 to 1854. Although Peale introduced many innovations to the Mint of the United States, he was eventually dismissed amid allegations he had used his position for personal gain.Peale was the son of painter Charles Willson Peale, and was born in the museum of curiosities that his father ran in Philadelphia. For the most part, Franklin Peale's education was informal, though he took some classes at the University of Pennsylvania. He became adept in machine making. In 1820, he became an assistant to his father at the museum, and managed it after Charles Peale's death in 1827.In 1833, Peale was hired by the Mint, and was sent for two years to Europe to study and report back on coining techniques. He returned with plans for improvement, and designed the first steam-powered coinage press in the United States, installed in 1836. Peale was made Melter and Refiner of the Philadelphia Mint that year, and Chief Coiner three years later upon the retirement of the incumbent, Adam Eckfeldt, who continued in his work without pay.  Eckfeldt's labor allowed Peale to run a medal business using Mint property. This sideline eventually caused Peale's downfall: conflicts with Engraver James B. Longacre and Melter and Refiner Richard Sears McCulloh led to Peale being accused of misconduct, and he was dismissed by President Franklin Pierce in 1854.In retirement, Peale continued his involvement in and leadership of many civic organizations; he died in 1870. Numismatic author Q. David Bowers suggests that the facts of Peale's career allow writers to draw very different conclusions about him.

Francis Bassett	Question: question: What was Sir Francis Bassett's title from 1642 to 1644?	Ref: High Sheriff of Cornwall	Pred: High Sheriff of Cornwall	Context: Sir Francis Bassett (1594 – 1645) of Tehidy in the parish of Illogan in Cornwall, was Sheriff of Cornwall, a Vice-Admiral of North Cornwall, and Recorder of St Ives. His portrait by Vandyck was formerly displayed at Tehidy (now demolished). He appears to have been a sportsman, much addicted to hawking and cock-fighting.He was the son of Revd. James Bassett of Tehidy and his wife Jane, the daughter of Sir Francis Godolphin.He served as Vice-Admiral of North Cornwall from 1623 to his death in 1645 and was High Sheriff of Cornwall in 1642–1644. There is a complaint against him in the Star Chamber, 18 May 1625.During the Civil War in 1643, he acted as a Royalist in the western part of Cornwall, raising money and drilling forces for the king. Letters of his to his wife ‘at her Tehidy’ are preserved, recording the Royalist victories of Stamford Hill near Stratton, and of Braddock Down near Lostwithiel, at the latter of which (or at any rate very shortly after the fight) he, with most of the Cornish gentry, was present, and was knighted on the field.

Heinrich Roth	Question: question: Along with Kannada and Hindustani, what language did Roth learn?	Ref: Persian	Pred: Persian	Context: Heinrich Roth (December 18, 1620 in Dillingen, Germany – June 20, 1668 in Agra; also known as Henricus Rodius or Henrique Roa) was a missionary and pioneering Sanskrit scholar. Having been born in Dillingen and raised in Augsburg, where his father Konrad Roth (died 1637) worked as Doctor utriusque iuris for the Prince-Bishopric, from 1635 to 1639 Heinrich Roth studied Rhetoric at the University of Dillingen and Philosophy at the Jesuit college in Innsbruck. In 1639, he became a Jesuit in Landsberg, and from 1641 to 1645 taught at the University of Munich, before returning to Dillingen to start theological studies, which he completed in Ingolstadt in 1649. The same year, he was ordained priest in Eichstätt.On behalf of Francesco Piccolomini, in 1649 Roth was assigned to the so-called Ethiopian mission to India. Traveling by the land route via Smyrna (1650) and Isfahan, he arrived in Goa by 1652. He worked first on the Island of Salsette off Goa, where from time to time he acted as Portuguese interpreter. He was then sent on an embassy by one of the native princes, and via Uttarakhand finally reached the Mughal Empire and its residence in Agra in 1654. Acting as rector of the Jesuit residence in Agra since 1659, he was involved in the persecution under Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb.Next to learning the Persian, Kannada and Hindustani languages, Roth at Agra for several years also acquired a profound knowledge of classical Sanskrit grammar and literature from local pandits. The French explorer and philosopher Francois Bernier, who got acquainted with Roth in these years, got to appreciate him as one versed in expert knowledge of the culture and philosophy of religions in IndiaIn 1662, joined by fellow Jesuit Johann Grueber, who was on his way back from China, Roth revisited Europe by the land route via Kabul, and arrived in Rome in February 1664. Athanasius Kircher, in his monumental work China illustrata, published their itinerary, Roth’s description of the Sanskrit alphabet, and some short excerpts of Roth’s other works. Traveling north to Germany, Roth held some public lectures in Neuburg on the history and culture of the Mughal Empire, excerpts of which subsequently appeared in print. In Vienna, Roth succeeded in gaining financial support from emperor Leopold I to have his Sanskrit grammar – the first such work ever compiled by a European, which Roth had completed in Agra by 1660 – appear in print, but the project was stopped by the Jesuit Superior General Giovanni Paolo Oliva.Ordered by Oliva to set up a Jesuit mission in Nepal, Roth traveled back via Constantinople and Surat, returning to Agra by 1666, where he died in 1668 before he could embark on the Nepalese mission. His gravesite is still visible at the Padri Santos chapel in Lashkarpur, a suburb of Agra.
Benjamin Henry Latrobe	Question: question: What was the name of the Virginia Penitentiary Latrobe designed?	Ref: State	Pred: The United States Capitol	Context: Benjamin Henry Boneval Latrobe (May 1, 1764 – September 3, 1820) was an Anglo-American neoclassical architect who emigrated to the United States. He was one of the first formally trained, professional architects in the new United States, drawing on influences from his travels in Italy, as well as British and French Neoclassical architects such as Claude Nicolas Ledoux. In his thirties, he emigrated to the new United States and designed the United States Capitol, on "Capitol Hill" in Washington, D.C., as well as the Old Baltimore Cathedral or The Baltimore Basilica, (later renamed the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary). It is the first Cathedral constructed in the United States for any Christian denomination. Latrobe also designed the largest structure in America at the time, the "Merchants' Exchange" in Baltimore. With extensive balconied atriums through the wings and a large central rotunda under a low dome which dominated the city, it was completed in 1820 after five years of work and endured into the early twentieth century.Latrobe emigrated in 1796, initially settling in Virginia where he worked on the Virginia State Penitentiary in Richmond. Latrobe then moved to Philadelphia where he established his practice. In 1803, he was hired as Surveyor of the Public Buildings of the United States, and spent much of the next fourteen years working on projects in the new national capital of Washington, D.C., (in the newly-laid out Federal capital of the District of Columbia) where he served as the second Architect of the Capitol. He also was responsible for the design of the White House porticos. Latrobe spent the later years of his life in New Orleans, Louisiana working on a waterworks project, and died there in 1820 from yellow fever.Latrobe has been called the "father of American architecture". He was the uncle of Charles La Trobe, who was the first Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria in Australia.

Nicholas Geffroy	Question: question: What position did Nicholas Geffroy hold in 1817?	Ref: Newport's Surveyor of Highways	Pred: Surveyor of Highways	Context: Nicholas Geffroy (c. 1761 - before February 9, 1839) was an American silversmith and watchmaker, active in Newport, Rhode Island.Geffroy was born in Granville, Manche in France. He married Sarah Shaw in Newport on September 29, 1795, and before 1802 became a partner with her father, John Allen Shaw, as JOHN A. SHAW & Co. In June 1817 he was appointed Newport's Surveyor of Highways.In a curious incident in 1801, a letter to President Thomas Jefferson was sent from someone purporting to be Geffroy. The letter detailed accusations against many citizens and office-holders, and insisted that "A purification is necessary, & we cannot be purified unless you cleanse the Augean Stable completely." Geffroy received a response from Jefferson, but doubted its authenticity and denied having ever written to the President. The United States Senator Christopher Ellery, a local resident, vouched for its authenticity and apparently impounded the letter for return to Jefferson. Ellery in turn accused Congressman John Rutledge Jr. of South Carolina, also then resident in Newport, of having forged this and another letter from Geffroy. These "Geffroy letters" were subsequently published in the Newport Rhode-Island Republican on September 18, 1802, under the headline "Rutledge's Letters To the President of the United States." As noted in that article, although Geffroy possessed some mastery of spoken English, it was doubted that he could write, "with any degree of correctness, a single sentence of the language." After a flurry of accusations and affidavits, Rutledge challenged Ellery to a duel, which he declined. Rutledge assaulted Ellery in January 1803, "publicly caning him and pulling him by the nose and ears". Although Rutledge vehemently maintained his innocence in the affair, he decided not to seek reelection in 1803 given the negative publicity.In another curious incident recorded by Channing, "a sudden and most malignant disease appeared in the house of Mr. Nicholas Geffroy... supposed to have originated from some foul substances thrown upon the ground occupied by Mr. Geffroy." Several of Geffroy's mechanics died within a few hours of being attacked, but the illness did not spread beyond a few houses on either side of Geffroy.Geffroy's work is collected in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Yale University Art Gallery.

His son, the medalist Christian Fueter, was born in London in 1752, and Fueter himself is mentioned in W. Chaffee's Gilda Aurifabrorum as living in Chelsea, "next door to Man in ye Moon, on the 8th December, 1753." Around 1754 he arrived in New York City, where he was made freeman in 1759 and established his business as gold and silversmith. While in New York, he published a series of advertisements:Daniel Fueter, Gold and Silver-Smith, Lately arrived in the Snow Irene, Capt.

He is known for developing a technique for processing laminated rosewood in many layers to achieve thin panels that, once shaped in molds through steam heating, were finely carved. This style which became very popular in NYC, was widely copied by his competitors in New York, Philadelphia, and Boston.Belter died in New York City and his business was carried on by his brothers-in-law, the Springmyers.
Meissen porcelain	Question: question: What type of porcelain was the first hard-paste porcelain?	Ref: European	Pred: Meissen porcelain	Context: Meissen porcelain or Meissen china was the first European hard-paste porcelain. Early experiments were done in 1708 by Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus. After his death that October, Johann Friedrich Böttger continued von Tschirnhaus's work and brought this type of porcelain to the market, financed by Augustus the Strong, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony. The production of porcelain in the royal factory at Meissen, near Dresden, started in 1710 and attracted artists and artisans to establish, arguably, the most famous porcelain manufacturer known throughout the world. Its signature logo, the crossed swords, was introduced in 1720 to protect its production; the mark of the swords is reportedly one of the oldest trademarks in existence. Dresden porcelain (or "china")  was once the usual term for these wares, until in 1975 the Oberlandesgericht (Higher Munich State Court) decided in favour of the Saxon Porcelain Manufactory Dresden, which alone was then allowed to use the name Dresden Porcelain (it ceased producing in 2020).Meissen remained the dominant European porcelain factory, and the leader of stylistic innovation, until somewhat overtaken by the new styles introduced by the French Sèvres factory in the 1760s, but has remained a leading factory to the present day. Among the developments pioneered by Meissen are the porcelain figurines, and the introduction of European decorative styles to replace the imitation of Asian decoration of its earliest wares.Since 1991, the manufactory has been operating as the Staatliche Porzellan-Manufaktur Meissen GmbH, whose owner is the Free State of Saxony. The company is one of the world's leading porcelain manufacturers and one of the oldest and most internationally known German luxury brands.
William Louis Sonntag, Sr.	Question: question: Where did Sonntag travel to in 1853?	Ref: Italy	Pred: Florence, Italy	Context: William Louis Sonntag Sr. (1822–1900) was an American landscape painter. Born near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1822, he traveled to Cincinnati, Ohio, at the age of 21 and perfected his technique. Becoming an established and highly regarded landscape artist, he began making trips to Florence, Italy in 1853. Several of these trips were made with his friend Robert Seldon Duncanson.In 1856, Sonntag permanently moved to New York to become a leading painter of Romantic landscapes of several scenes from his travels in Italy. Sonntag was a member of the group known as the Hudson River School. Some of his paintings go beyond the movement to a grandiose expression of Manifest Destiny.There is strong evidence that several of Sonntag's pieces were scenes he had seen from photographs only.  Grand Canyon, Yellowstone River, Wyoming, for example, is a landscape that Sonntag never traveled to.  It is most likely based on a photograph taken by Frank Jay Haynes of the canyon in 1885.His son, William Louis Sonntag Jr. (1869–1898), was also a painter, and an illustrator.

Grueby Faience Company	Question: question: What company was the Grueby Faience Company founded on?	Ref: on Grueby	Pred: American ceramics	Context: The Grueby Faience Company, founded in 1894, was an American ceramics company that produced distinctive American art pottery vases and tiles during America's Arts and Crafts Movement.The company was founded in Revere, Massachusetts, by William Henry Grueby (Boston, 1867—New York, 1925), who had been inspired by the matte glazes on French pottery and the refined simplicity of Japanese ceramics he had seen at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago the previous year; and the architect-designer William Graves. During its first years, the company produced glazed architectural terra cotta and faience tiles. The company initially focused on simple art pottery vases designed by George Prentiss Kendrick. Beginning in 1897 and 1898, Grueby introduced matte glazes, including the matte cucumber green that became the company's hallmark.Grueby's work won two gold medals and one silver medal at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris; medals at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York; and a gold medal at both the 1901 St. Petersburg Exhibition of Ceramics and the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis.Grueby Faience stood in the mainstream of Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau design in the United States. Graves and Kendrick were eventually replaced by the architect Addison LeBoutillier and Henry Belknap, who had worked with Louis Comfort Tiffany. Later, Karl Langenbeck, formerly of the Rookwood Pottery, would superintend design. Soon Grueby vases were for sale at Samuel Bing's shop in Paris, L'Art Nouveau, which gave a name to the progressive art movement, and through Tiffany & Co. in New York, where Tiffany Studios used Grueby lamp bases.  Gustav Stickley incorporated Grueby tiles in his stands and tables, shared a stand with Grueby at the Pan-American Exposition, and through his catalog offered Grueby vases and lamps.Grueby's work incited mass-market competition and the company went bankrupt in 1909. Grueby emerged from bankruptcy and began limited production runs that included statues, pottery, and tiles until 1911. There was a fire in the manufactory in 1913, but Grueby rebuilt. In 1917, the C. Pardee Works in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, bought out the company's works; the Grueby company closed for good in 1920.Grueby Faience Company, which still remains better known for its art pottery, also produced glazed architectural tiles, which were impressed in molds. Grueby polychrome glazed tiles can still be seen in the revetments of Interborough Rapid Transit Company subway stations in New York and making up the thirty-six original tile murals in the main lobby of Scranton, Pennsylvania's Lackawanna Train Station (restored in 2007-09).The standard monograph is Susan J. Montgomery, The Ceramics of William H. Grueby: The Spirit of New Idea in Artistic Handicraft, 1993.

Samuel Colman	Question: question: What country did Colman visit for the first time?	Ref: Spain	Pred: France and Spain	Context: Samuel Colman (March 4, 1832 – March 26, 1920) was an American painter, interior designer, and writer, probably best remembered for his paintings of the Hudson River. Born in Portland, Maine, Colman moved to New York City with his family as a child. His father opened a bookstore, attracting a literate clientele that may have influenced Colman's artistic development. He is believed to have studied briefly under the Hudson River School painter Asher Durand, and he exhibited his first work at the National Academy of Design in 1850. By 1854 he had opened his own New York City studio. The following year he was elected an associate member of the National Academy, with full membership bestowed in 1862.His landscape paintings in the 1850s and 1860s were influenced by the Hudson River School, an example being Meadows and Wildflowers at Conway (1856) now in the collection of the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar College. He was also able to paint in a romantic style, which had become more fashionable after the Civil War. One of his best-known works, and one of the iconic images of Hudson River School art, is his Storm King on the Hudson (1866), now in the collection of the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC.In the 1860s, Colman lived in Irvington, New York, where he made a number of paintings featuring the countryside around the village. Louis Comfort Tiffany, inventor of Tiffany glass, studied with Colman when he lived there.Colman was an inveterate traveler, and many of his works depict scenes from foreign cities and ports. He made his first trip abroad to France and Spain in 1860–1861, and returned for a more extensive four-year European tour in the early 1870s in which he spent much time in Mediterranean locales. Colman often depicted the architectural features he encountered on his travels: cityscapes, castles, bridges, arches, and aqueducts feature prominently in his paintings of foreign scenes. In 1870 and again in the 1880s he journeyed to the western United States, painting western landscapes comparable in scope and style to those of Thomas Moran.In the aftermath of the Civil War, watercolor painting became more popular. In 1866, Colman was one of the founders of the American Watercolor Society, and he became its first president from 1867 to 1871. Colman also became skilled at the medium of etching. He was an early member of the New York Etching Club, and published popular etchings depicting European scenes.Colman's artistic activities became even more diverse late in life. By the 1880s he worked extensively as an interior designer, collaborating with his friend Louis Comfort Tiffany on the design of Samuel Clemens' Hartford home, and later on the Fifth Avenue home of Henry and Louisine Havemeyer. He also became a major collector of Asian decorative objects, and wrote two books on geometry and art, one of which was entitled Nature's Harmonic Unity, the other which was entitled Proportional Form.Colman died in New York City in 1920. He was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York.
Virgil	Question: question: What is considered a national epic of ancient Rome?	Ref: Aeneid	Pred: Aeneid	Context: Publius Vergilius Maro (Classical Latin: [ˈpuːbliʊs wɛrˈɡɪliʊs ˈmaroː]; traditional dates 15 October 70 – 21 September 19 BC), usually called Virgil or Vergil ( VUR-jil) in English, was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period. He composed three of the most famous poems in Latin literature: the Eclogues (or Bucolics), the Georgics, and the epic Aeneid. A number of minor poems, collected in the Appendix Vergiliana, were attributed to him in ancient times, but modern scholars consider his authorship of these poems as dubious.Virgil's work has had wide and deep influence on Western literature, most notably Dante's Divine Comedy, in which Virgil appears as the author's guide through Hell and Purgatory.Virgil has been traditionally ranked as one of Rome's greatest poets. His Aeneid is also considered a national epic of ancient Rome, a title held since composition.

Francis Alexander	Question: question: Who did Francis Alexander paint a portrait of?	Ref: Dickens	Pred: Charles Dickens	Context: Francis Alexander (February 3, 1800 – March 27, 1880) was an American portrait-painter. Alexander was born in Windham county Connecticut in February 1800. Brought up on a farm, he taught himself the use of colors, and in 1820 went to New York City and studied painting with Alexander Robertson.He spent the winters of 1831 and 1832 in Rome. Afterwards, he resided for nearly a decade in Boston, Massachusetts, where he had considerable vogue, and where he painted a portrait of Charles Dickens (1842).In 1840 he was elected to the National Academy of Design as an honorary member. There is a tradition that when Dickens visited Boston, a line of New England portraitists was already fawning on shore, hoping to be the first to capture the great novelist's image on canvas. But Francis Alexander reached the writer well ahead of his peers—by traveling in a small advance boat to greet Dickens as his vessel entered the harbor. American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (whom Alexander also painted) would later coin the verb Alexandered (as in, wangled), sniffing that such and such a person had Alexandered his way into a highly coveted invitation to a party.

More than 700 portraits have been attributed to him. He was born in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 1768.  He moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1790, and married Zipporah Wood in 1794. Some time later he moved to Albany, New York, where he painted a number of prominent people, including early portraits of Governor George Clinton and Alexander Hamilton.It is not known whether Ames was formally trained or not, but his work had a popular appeal. In addition to portraits and landscapes, Ames' surviving accounts books indicated he painted miniatures, carriages, fire buckets, fences, mirror frames, and furniture.Ames painted a number of still lifes, landscapes, and history paintings, and was skilled at engraving. The Chautauqan Magazine describes his importance in this way; "(he) was the most noted portraitist in the state, outside New York city. The sure and fluent ease of his brush, his keen characterization, his pure, fresh coloring, are all remarkable for this early period. His portrait of Governor George Clinton, exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy in 1812, won him wide notice; but he did delightful work some years earlier, and many even finer canvases are scattered through the middle states, in private hands."During his career Ames painted many members of the New York State legislature and retired comfortably on his savings built up during his prolific career, primarily between 1800 and 1820. In fact he became known unofficially as the (official) New York State portrait painter. Ames was an active freemason, which brought him a number of commissions from his fellows.Ames served as chairman of the Fine Arts Committee of the Society for the Promotion of Useful Arts in 1805, and was also President of the Mechanics' and Farmers' Bank of Albany.He died in 1836 and is buried at the Albany Rural Cemetery (Lot 1 Section 59).

William Henry Bartlett	Question: question: Who published a posthumous History of the United States of North America?	Ref: Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward	Pred: Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward	Context: William Henry Bartlett (March 26, 1809 – September 13, 1854) was a British artist, best known for his numerous drawings rendered into steel engravings. Bartlett was born in Kentish Town, London in 1809. He was apprenticed to John Britton (1771–1857), and became one of the foremost illustrators of topography of his generation. He travelled throughout Britain, and in the mid and late 1840s he travelled extensively in the Balkans and the Middle East. He made four visits to North America between 1836 and 1852.In 1835, Bartlett first visited the United States to draw the buildings, towns and scenery of the northeastern states. The finely detailed steel engravings Bartlett produced were published uncolored with a text by Nathaniel Parker Willis as American Scenery; or Land, Lake, and River: Illustrations of Transatlantic Nature. American Scenery was published by George Virtue in London in 30 monthly installments from 1837 to 1839. Bound editions of the work were published from 1840 onward. In 1838 Bartlett was in the Canadas producing sketches for Willis' Canadian scenery illustrated, published in 1842. Following a trip to the Middle East, he published Walks about the city and environs of Jerusalem in 1840.Bartlett made sepia wash drawings the exact size to be engraved.  His engraved views were widely copied by artists, but no signed oil painting by his hand is known. Engravings based on Bartlett's views were later used in his posthumous History of the United States of North America, continued by Bernard Bolingbroke Woodward and published around 1856.Bartlett’s primary concern was to render "lively impressions of actual sights", as he wrote in the preface to The Nile Boat (London, 1849). Many views contain some ruin or element of the past including many scenes of churches, abbeys, cathedrals and castles, and Nathaniel Parker Willis described Bartlett's talent thus: "Bartlett could select his point of view so as to bring prominently into his sketch the castle or the cathedral, which history or antiquity had allowed".Bartlett returning from his last trip to the Near East suddenly took ill and died of fever on board the French steamer Egyptus off the coast of Malta in 1854. His widow Susanna lived for almost 50 years after his death, and died in London on 25 October 1902, aged 91.

The elder brother of painter Gifford Beal, Reynolds was born in New York City.  He and his brother Gifford spent their summers at Wilellyn in Newburgh, New York, on the Hudson River, and together they would later design the gardens at Wilellyn.

Beal was a man of independent means, and was thus able to devote his life to his art without having always to appeal to the tastes of his patrons or to contemporary trends.Beal showed artistic ability from an early age, but temporarily postponed his creative interests to enroll at university. He first studied at Cornell University (naval architecture), where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and the Irving Literary Society. Beal painted and sketched in and around Cayuga Lake.  His home haunts of the East River were the first subjects of his work; in Sibley Hall’s drafting bays he learned further technique as a budding naval architect. Although the “Sibley time” constitutes his first artistic experience, it was not until the years following graduation that Beal became serious about a painting career.

He was the son of Joseph Birch, a coffee-mill maker, and was born at Clerkenwell.He preferred study to business but, as his parents were Quakers, he did not go to the university. Notwithstanding this circumstance, he was ordained deacon in the Church of England in 1730 and priest in 1731. As a strong supporter of the Whigs, he gained the favour of Philip Yorke, afterwards Lord Chancellor and first Earl of Hardwicke, and his subsequent preferments were largely due to this friendship. He held successively a number of benefices in different counties, and finally in London.He was noted as a keen fisherman during the course of his lifetime, and devised an unusual method of disguising his intentions. Dressed as a tree, he stood by the side of a stream in an outfit designed to make his arms seem like branches and the rod and line a spray of blossom. Any movement, he argued, would be taken by a fish to be the consequences of a mild breeze.In 1735 he became a member of the Society of Antiquaries, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, of which he was secretary from 1752 to 1765. In 1728 he had married Hannah Cox, who died in the following year. Birch was killed on 9 January 1766 by a fall from his horse, and was buried in the church of St Margaret Pattens, London, of which he was then rector. He died, according to his will, "in a full confidence in the Mercy and Goodness of almighty God and with a firm persuasion of a blessed Immortality discoverable by the Light of Nature and confirmed for us Christians by that of Revelation", leaving his books and manuscripts to the British Museum, and a sum of about £500 to increase the salaries of the three assistant librarians.
William Russell Birch	Question: question: What organization awarded Birch a medal in 1785?	Ref: Royal Society of Arts	Pred: Royal Society of Arts	Context: William Russell Birch (9 April 1755 – 7 August 1834) was an English miniature painter, enameler, and landscape engraver and designer. Birch was born in Warwickshire, the son of Anne, née Russell, and physician Thomas Birch. He spent his early childhood in Warwick and was apprenticed to a jeweler, Thomas Jeffreys, and to Sir Joshua Reynolds. The enamelist Henry Spicer trained Birch in the art of enamel painting. Birch exhibited enamel portraits at the Royal Academy from 1781 to 1794. In 1785, he received a medal from the Royal Society of Arts. As an engraver he is best known in England for his Délices de la Grande Bretagne, consisting of thirty-six plates of ancient buildings in Norwich and elsewhere, published in 1791.After emigrating to Philadelphia in 1794 he made portrait enamels of many people including copies of portraits of George Washington, by Gilbert Stuart. The engraving series he made in 1800 of Philadelphia vistas was so extremely popular it resulted in three additional editions. William Birch was the father of Thomas Birch, an American portrait and marine painter. Typescript copies of his autobiography are held by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. He died in Philadelphia, aged 79.

During the American Civil War he served as a private in the 23rd Connecticut Volunteers in the Department of the Gulf (1862–1863), and on being mustered out became acting assistant paymaster in the South Atlantic Squadron. At the close of the war he joined his father's marble business in Poughkeepsie, New York.He studied the art of sculpture abroad in 1875–1876, and lived much in Paris during the years 1883–1896, with occasional visits to America. Bissell also created smaller works, such as a bust of President Abraham Lincoln as well as a larger statue of the president.
Karl Bitter	Question: question: In what city did Bitter model the Jefferson statue?	Ref: Cleveland	Pred: Cleveland	Context: Karl Theodore Francis Bitter  (December 6, 1867 – April 9, 1915) was an Austrian-born American sculptor best known for his architectural sculpture, memorials and residential work. The son of Carl and Henrietta Bitter, he was born in the municipal district Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus of Vienna. His early training took place at the Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule (the imperial school for the applied arts), and after that at the Kunstakademie (the Academy of Fine Arts). At the Academy, he studied with August Kühne and Edmund Heller. Upon his graduation, he was apprenticed to an architectural sculptor,Joseph Kaffsack. This was the period that the Ringstraße was being built in Vienna, and a large number of decorated buildings were being built.He was drafted into the Austrian Army, and deserted while on leave. He was unable to return to Austria for many years because of his desertion. He later was pardoned by Emperor Franz Josef of Austria, who hoped to lure the famous sculptor back to Vienna.Bitter immigrated to the United States in 1889, arriving in New York City. He applied for citizenship, and set to work as an assistant with a firm of house decorators. While employed with this firm, at age 21, he competed for the Astor memorial bronze gates of Trinity Church and won. The work gave him sufficient capital to build and establish a small studio on 13th Street.Bitter modeled seated statues of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton to flank the entrance to the Cuyahoga County Courthouse in Cleveland, Ohio (1909–11). He portrayed the men in early middle age, as in the 1780s when they clashed over what kind of nation the United States should become. Missouri commissioned a copy of Jefferson (1913), and Bitter made minor alterations to portray Jefferson as he looked as president when he signed the Louisiana Purchase Treaty in 1803. For the commission from the University of Virginia, Bitter aged Jefferson further, portraying him as he looked in retirement.About this time, Bitter was discovered by Richard Morris Hunt, the architect of choice of many of New York's rich and famous. From that time on Bitter was never without work. After working as a sculptor at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 and as director at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York in 1901, Bitter's extraordinary organizational skills led him to be named head of the sculpture programs at both the 1904 St. Louis Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri, where Lee Lawrie trained with his guidance, and the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition held in San Francisco, California. In 1906/1907, he presided over the National Sculpture Society.Among the awards won by Bitter were the silver medal of the Paris Exposition, 1900; the gold medal of the Pan-American Exposition, 1901; a gold medal at Philadelphia, 1902; and the gold medal at the St. Louis Exposition, 1904. He was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Sciences, vice-president (1906–08 and 1914–15); the National Academy of Design, to which he was elected in 1902; the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Players' Club, Century Club, and vice-president of the Architectural League from 1904 to 1906 and from 1909 to 1911, and member of the Art Commission, New York, from 1912 to 1915.Although Bitter arose out of the Classical/Naturalist styles he was increasingly turning towards a more modern approach to sculpture. Much of the work in Buffalo and St. Louis was allegorical in nature. Where this would have taken him will never be known, because he was killed in an accident in 1915 when, while leaving the Metropolitan Opera in New York, a car jumped the curb on Broadway and struck him down. His wife survived the accident as he had pushed her out of the way of the oncoming car.Like many of the sculptors and painters of the day, Bitter frequently employed the services of the muse and history's first "super model", Audrey Munson. On June 30, 1901, he married Marie A. Schevill, of Cincinnati, Ohio. They had three children: Francis T. R. Bitter, Marietta C. E. Bitter and John F. Bitter. Their son Francis Bitter, born in 1902, became a prominent American physicist.For a time, Bitter's studio was located in a building known as The Castle in Weehawken, New Jersey. The Castle was created as a part of the Eldorado Amusement Park.

Ralph Albert Blakelock	Question: question: When was Ralph Albert Blakelock born?	Ref: October	Pred: October 15, 1847	Context: Ralph Albert Blakelock (October 15, 1847 – August 9, 1919) was a romanticist American painter known primarily for his landscape paintings related to the Tonalism movement. Ralph Blakelock was born in New York City on October 15, 1847, the son of Caroline Olinarg (Carry) and Ralph B. Blakelock, who was born in England. His father was a successful physician.  Blakelock initially set out to follow in his footsteps, and in 1864 began studies at the Free Academy of the City of New York (now known as the City College).  He dropped out after his third term, opting to forgo formal education.  From 1869–72 he traveled alone through the American West, wandering far from American settlements and spending time among the American Indians.  Largely self-taught as an artist, he began producing competent landscapes, as well as scenes of Indian life, based on his notebooks he filled while traveling and on his personal memories and feelings.  Blakelock's works were exhibited in the National Academy of Design.In 1877 Blakelock married Cora Rebecca Bailey; they had nine children. In art, Blakelock was a genius, yet, in business dealings and in monetary transactions he proved a failure. He found it difficult, if not crushing to maintain and support his wife and children. In desperation he found himself selling his paintings for extremely low prices, far beneath their known worth. In hopes of lifting his family from abject poverty, reportedly on the day his 9th child was born, Blakelock had offered a painting to a collector for $1000. The collector made a counter offer and after refusing the proposed sum Blakelock found himself in a bitter argument with his wife. After the domestic dispute, Blakelock returned to the patron and sold the painting for a much lesser sum. Defeated and frustrated, it is said he broke down and tore the cash into pieces. And so it was after such repeated failed business transactions that he began to suffer from extreme depression and eventually show symptoms of mental frailty.Blakelock suffered his first mental breakdown in 1891, while living with his brother in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. For financial assistance, he began selling his paintings, including 30 to 40 to vaudeville performer Lew Bloom between 1889 and 1892. His depression manifested in schizophrenic delusions in which he believed himself immensely wealthy – perhaps a compensation for his long struggle to provide for his family.  In 1899, he suffered his final breakdown and spent almost the entire remaining twenty years of his life in mental institutions.Almost as soon as Blakelock went into the first psychiatric hospital, his works began to receive recognition. Within a few years the paintings he had once sold for next to nothing were resold for several thousand dollars.  In 1916, Blakelock was made an Academician of the National Academy of Design.  Meanwhile, Blakelock languished in the mental asylum of Middletown State Homeopathic Hospital, whose administration and staff were unaware of his fame as an artist, and who viewed his belief that his paintings were in major museums as one more sign of his illness. While confined he continued to paint in ink, painting on the backs of cardboard and various supports, substituting bark and his own hair for brushes.In 1916, one of Blakelock's landscapes sold at auction for $20,000, setting a record for a painting by a living American artist. It was this impressive price that captured the imagination of Sadie Filbert, who had reinvented herself as the socially prominent Beatrice Van Rensselaer Adams so that she could swindle the wealthy by persuading them to donate to charitable causes that would, in fact, serve to enrich herself. She founded and milked the Blakelock Fund, which was supposed to support the impecunious artist and his needy brood. She informed Harrison Smith, then a young reporter with the New York Tribune, of Blakelock's whereabouts, and he went to see Blakelock in the asylum. He found him largely lucid, although under the delusion that an imagined "diamond of the Emperor of Brazil" had been stolen from him. Smith explained to the asylum director who Blakelock was, and managed to arrange to bring Blakelock and the director to Manhattan, where a major gallery retrospective of Blakelock's work was taking place. Blakelock was awed by the changes in the city in the two decades since he had last seen it, and thrilled to see the recognition his work had received. Smith scored himself a major news story. (In a 1945 account, Smith added that Blakelock had quietly informed him that several of the paintings were forgeries, but Smith chose not to put that in his story because of the question of how far he could rely on the word of the less than fully sane Blakelock.) These events led to Blakelock's release from the asylum, in the "care" of Sadie Filbert, alias Beatrice Van Rensselaer Adams, who milked him for all he was worth.He continued painting until his death at the age of 71 on August 9, 1919.

George Henry Bogert	Question: question: Where did Bogert paint with Eugène Boudin?	Ref: Netherlands	Pred: Étaples on the French coast	Context: George Henry Bogert (February 6, 1864 – December 13, 1944) was an American landscape painter. George Henry Bogert was born in New York City, the son of Henry Bogert and Helen Anderson Evans.  His father was a paper manufacturer, and a noted collector of coins, medals, and writings on numismatics.  As a student at the National Academy of Design and later under Thomas Eakins in New York City, he early on displayed the talent that later brought him fame.In 1884 he went to France and painted landscapes for a time at Grez, near the forest of Fontainebleau, afterwards going to Paris, where he studied under Colin, Aimé Morot, and Pierre Puvis de Chavannes.  Four years later he returned to New York and thereafter until his death was a frequent exhibitor at the Society of American Artists, the National Academy of Design, and elsewhere. In 1899, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member.It was in 1901 that his landscape work began to attract attention.  At the outset his achievements were tentative, but evidenced sincerity and promise.  Within a few years it was evident that the artist was rapidly approaching the completeness that marks reflective work, and his paintings testified to the maturity of his style.  In his summer journeys abroad he painted at Étaples on the French coast with Eugène Boudin and in the Netherlands and on the Isle of Wight.  In these surroundings he found sympathetic material for many of his subsequent works.  His compositions were said to preserve that truth in nature which represents true art and he became a profound synthesist, ever seeking to secure unity of ensemble and endeavoring to avoid striking a false note in his efforts to produce harmony of color and effect.  His success in this direction is strikingly illustrated in his composition "Sea and Rain", and in many of his pictures the scope of his artistic vision is wide and comprehensive.  A most prolific painter whose work found a ready and discriminating market.  Bogert was exceedingly versatile, a characteristic that prevented him from having pronounced style.In 1911 an exhibit of his work was held at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York, and attracted widespread notice.  His work is represented in the permanent collection of the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy, thanks to a gift from the New York merchant, George Hearn.  In 1911 and 1914 he painted at the Old Lyme Art Colony in Old Lyme, Connecticut.In 1895 Bogert executed "The English Channel from St. Ives to Lelant", which was purchased by popular subscriptions in St. Louis and presented to the St. Louis Museum of Fine Arts.  He won honorable mention at the Pennsylvanian Academy of Fine Arts in 1892; was awarded the Webb Prize at the exhibition of American artists in 1868 for "Evening, Honfleur"; received the 1899 First Hallgarten Prize from the National Academy of Design; won a bronze medal at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1900; was awarded silver medals at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in 1901 and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904, and received gold medals from the American Society of Arts in 1902 and 1907.Bogerts work has been displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, National Gallery, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Buffalo Fine Arts Academy, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Huntington Library, Pennsylvania Academy, Brooklyn Museum, Edinburgh Museum in Scotland, Shanghai Club in China, Minneapolis Institute of Art, and others, also in private collections, including those of Andrew Carnegie, Clarence Mackay, and Thomas B. Clark.He married on June 2, 1865 Baltimore Maryland to Margaret Austin Merryman, daughter of Joseph P.

He began to paint portraits while still a boy, studied painting in Boston under Chester Harding, learned a little about modelling, and in 1836-1839 spent his summers working as a railroad engineer to earn enough to enable him to study further.He spent four years (1842–1846) in Italy; but returning to New York he wanted to ensure he remained distinctively American.

John George Brown	Question: question: What was the name of the show Brown painted in Paris in 1877?	Ref: Salon	Pred: Passing Show	Context: John George Brown (November 11, 1831 – February 8, 1913) was a British citizen and an American painter who specialized in genre scenes. John George Brown was born in Durham, England on November 11, 1831. His parents apprenticed him to the career of glass worker at the age of fourteen in an attempt to dissuade him from pursuing painting. He studied nights at the School of Design in Newcastle-on-Tyne while working as a glass cutter there between 1849 and 1852 and evenings at the Trustees Academy in Edinburgh while working at the Holyrood Glass Works between 1852 and 1853. After moving to New York City in 1853, he studied with Thomas Seir Cummings at the National Academy of Design where he was elected a National Academician in 1861.  Brown was the Academy's vice-president from 1899 to 1904.Around 1855, he worked for the owner of the Brooklyn Glass Company as a glassblower, and later married the daughter of his employer. His father-in-law encouraged his artistic abilities, supporting him financially, letting Brown pursue painting full-time. He established a studio in 1860 and, in 1866, he became one of the charter members of the Water-Color Society, of which he was president from 1887 to 1904. Brown became famous for his idealized depictions of street urchins in New York (bootblacks, street musicians, posy sellers, newsboys, etc.).His Passing Show (Paris, Salon, 1877) and Street Boys at Play (Paris Exhibition, 1900) are good examples of his popular talent.  Brown's art is best characterized as British genre paintings adapted to American subjects.  Essentially literary, Brown's paintings are executed with precise detail, but poor in color, and more popular with the general public than with connoisseurs. His paintings were quite popular with wealthy collectors. Many of Brown's paintings were reproduced as lithographs and widely distributed with packaged teas. He also painted some landscapes, just for pleasure.He died at his home in New York City on February 8, 1913.

Ref: Grand Tour	Pred: The Grand Tour	Context: Matilda Auchincloss Brownell (October 19, 1871 – September 15, 1966) was an American Impressionist painter and portraitist. Born into an upper class, well-connected family in New York City, Matilda Auchincloss Brownell was the daughter of New York City Bar Association Secretary Silas B. Brownell (1830-1918) and Sarah Stoddard Sheffield (1845-1922). Her paternal lineage traces back to Colonial settlers who came to New England in 1638.  In 1894 Brownell attended the Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art, where she was a student of William Merritt Chase.  During this same time period she also studied at the Art Students League of New York with Chase and formed a lasting friendship with Mary Cassatt, as evidenced in several letters written in the 1890s. Brownell then traveled to Paris to continue her studies at the Académie Colarossi and was a student of Frederick William MacMonnies.   During her time abroad, Matilda visited many countries, including Italy and England, in the tradition of the Grand Tour.  In Paris, Brownell met a fellow student and gifted sculptor named Janet Scudder. The two would become close friends, with Brownell's father Silas eventually helping to secure the struggling Scudder her first major commission to design the seal for the New York City Bar Association. In 1898 Brownell and Scudder returned to Paris together, living in an 18th-century house on Boulevard Raspail and once again attending Académie Colarossi, where the pair would draw from life in the evenings.

He was the literary father of what has been called "the university school of humour". He was born at Martley, Worcestershire, and given the name Charles Stuart Blayds.   In 1852, his father, the Rev. Henry Blayds, resumed the old family name of Calverley, which his grandfather had exchanged for Blayds in 1807. Charles went up to Balliol College, Oxford, from Harrow School in 1850, and was soon known in Oxford as the most daring and high-spirited undergraduate of his time. He was a universal favourite, a delightful companion, a brilliant scholar and the playful enemy of all "dons." In 1851 he won the Chancellor's prize for Latin verse, but it is said that the entire exercise was written in an afternoon, when his friends had locked him into his rooms, refusing to let him out until he had finished what they were confident would prove the prize poem.A year later, to avoid the consequences of a college escapade (he had been expelled from Oxford), like his father, he too changed his name to Calverley and moved to Christ's College, Cambridge.  Here he was again successful in Latin verse, the only undergraduate to have  won the Chancellor's prize at both universities. In 1856 he took second place in the first class in the Classical Tripos.

His first professional training was under prominent New York engraver Peter Maverick in the 1820s, then with Asher Durand, himself an engraver at the time. Casilear and Durand became friends, and both worked as engravers in New York through the 1830s.By the middle 1830s Durand had become interested in landscape painting through his friendship with Thomas Cole. Durand, in turn, drew Casilear's attention to painting. By 1840, Casilear's interest in art was sufficiently strong to accompany Durand, John Frederick Kensett, and artist Thomas Prichard Rossiter on a European trip during which they sketched scenes, visited art museums, and fostered their interest in painting.Casilear gradually developed his talent in landscape art, painting in the style that was later to become known as the Hudson River School. By the middle 1850s he had entirely ceased his engraving career in favor of painting full-time. He was elected a full member of the National Academy of Design in 1851, having been an associate member since 1833, and exhibited his works there for over fifty years.Casilear died in Saratoga Springs, New York in 1893.

Charles Robert Leslie	Question: question: Along with Shakespeare and Cervantes, Swift, Sterne, Fielding and Smollett, what French writer was a notable artist?	Ref: Molière	Pred: Addison and Molière	Context: Charles Robert Leslie  (19 October 1794 – 5 May 1859) was an English genre painter. Leslie was born in London to American parents. When he was five years of age he returned with them to the United States, where they settled in Philadelphia. Leslie completed his education and afterwards became apprenticed to a bookseller. He was, however, mainly interested in painting and drama, and when George Frederick Cooke visited the city he executed a portrait of the actor from recollection of him on the stage, which was considered a work of such promise that a fund was raised to enable the young artist to study in Europe.He left for London in 1811, bearing introductions which procured for him the friendship of West, Beechey, Allston, Coleridge and Washington Irving, being admitted as a student of the Royal Academy, where he carried off two silver medals. At first, influenced by West and Fuseli, he essayed high art, and his earliest important subject depicted Saul and the Witch of Endor; but he soon discovered his true aptitude and became a painter of cabinet-pictures, dealing, not like those of David Wilkie, with the contemporary life that surrounded him, but with scenes from the great masters of fiction, from Shakespeare and Cervantes, Addison and Molière, Swift, Sterne, Fielding and Smollett.In 1821, Leslie was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, and five years later full Royal Academician. In 1827 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician. In 1833, he left for America to become teacher of drawing in the military academy at West Point, but the post proved an irksome one, and in some six months he returned to England.

Charles Catton the younger	Question: question: Who was the son of Charles Catton the elder?	Ref: Charles Catton	Pred: Catton	Context: Charles Catton the younger (30 December 1756 – 24 April 1819) was an English-born American topographical artist, illustrator, theatrical scene-painter, and slave-owner. Catton, was born in London, the son of Charles Catton the elder. He received art tuition from his father and also studied at the Royal Academy schools. He travelled extensively through England and Scotland, making sketches, some of which were afterwards engraved and published. He was known as a scene-painter for the theatre, and also as a topographical artist.At the Royal Academy in 1775 he exhibited a View of London from Blackfriars Bridge, and one of Westminster from Westminster Bridge. In 1793, he showed designs, along with fellow artist E A Burney, for John Gay's Fables, which were subsequently published. At the Royal Academy from 1776 to 1800 he exhibited 37 works in total. In the latter, he was recorded as living in Purley. From 1781 to 1794, he was a scene painter at Covent Garden.In 1788 he published an early book of coloured aquatints, Animals Drawn from Nature and Engraved in Aqua-tinta.  The book included images and descriptions, written and etched by Catton, of thirty-six animals from around the world.He emigrated to the United States in 1804 and settled in a farm on the River Hudson with his two daughters and a son. There he lived until his death, painting occasionally. He is said to have "acquired wealth"' through his painting. He was also a slave owner. In 1815, he severely beat his slave, Robert, who was engaged in a relationship with Sojourner Truth, herself at the time enslaved on a neighboring farm. Catton died on 24 April 1819.
Jefferson David Chalfant	Question: question: What other art school did Chalfant exhibit?	Ref: National Academy of Design	Pred: Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts	Context: Jefferson David Chalfant (November 6, 1856 – February 3, 1931) was an American painter who is remembered mostly for his trompe-l'œil still life paintings. Chalfant was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania, but moved in young adulthood to Wilmington, Delaware, where he would spend the rest of his life. Employed by a commercial firm as a painter of parlor car interiors, he began his activity as a fine artist in the early 1880s. Although he had no formal training, he quickly developed a fine technique. His early works are mostly still-life and landscape paintings, which sold well to private collectors.Chalfant exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the National Academy of Design, and elsewhere. In 1890, he was able to travel to Paris for two years, where he studied figure painting under Adolphe-William Bouguereau and Jules Joseph Lefebvre. This served him well during a career in which he painted genre, portraits and other subjects. It's his still lifes which may be his signal achievement.His still lifes are painted in the illusionistic trompe-l'œil (literally, "fool the eye") manner popularized in the late nineteenth century by William Michael Harnett. Harnett inspired many followers, the best known being John F. Peto, but few, if any, had Chalfant's technical finesse. Often, Chalfant's compositions closely follow prototypes by Harnett, but Chalfant usually simplifies, eliminating secondary objects and details. An example is his Violin and Bow (1889) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET).Although he was only slightly younger than Harnett and Peto, he outlived both of them by many years, and continued painting until 1927, when he had a stroke. He died in Wilmington in 1931.A 2022 exhibition at the MET draws comparisons between the work of Chalfant, Harnet (as well as Europen trompe-l'œil painters such as Samuel van Hoogstraten, Cornelius Norbertus Gijsbrechts, Jean Etienne Liotard, and Luis Meléndez) and the work of Georges Braque, Juan Gris, and Pablo Picasso. One example is Chalafant's Which is Which, a highly realistic oil painting of a postage stamp with collage elements including an actual postage stamp and a fictitious printed newspaper clipping, hints at Cubism as well as foreshadowing the use of "faux collage" and fake news.

Ref: Antwerp	Pred: Antwerp	Context: James Wells Champney (July 16, 1843 – May 1, 1903) was an American genre artist and illustrator noted for his portraits, oriental scenes and American landscapes. Champney was born in Boston, the son of Benjamin and Sarah Wells Champney.  His mother died when he was quite young and he was raised by relatives. At the age of 16 years he began his career as an apprentice wood engraver and earned a living making wood engravings. At the outbreak of Civil War he left the apprenticeship and enlisted in the 45th Massachusetts Volunteers. He was at Gettysburg and during his service he contracted malaria  and was discharged. After the war he taught drawing for a short period and in 1866 he travelled to Europe where he studied under the genre painter, Edouard Frère in Ecouen. He later studied with Van Lerius at the Royal Academy in Antwerp. He returned to America in 1870 and opened an Academy, but was soon drawn back to Europe, settling in Rome for a time and visiting Paris.In 1873 he eloped with Elizabeth Williams, his former student of drawing, to save her from an arranged marriage. For three years following their marriage the couple travelled through Europe and were living in France when their first child was born. The family eventually settled in Deerfield, Massachusetts.James and Elizabeth became productive collaborators. Elizabeth contributed many articles and illustrations to magazines such as Scribners and Harper's and also authored several series of travel books, often with her husband providing the illustrations. James' etchings and illustrations were very popular and were used to illustrate books not only by his wife, but by other notable authors.In 1879 the Champneys purchased a second home on New York's fashionable Fifth Avenue, where James established a studio. He also maintained a studio at Deerfield, Massachusetts. Although he spent most of his time working at his New York studio, his favourite place of work was the studio at Deerfield.In 1880 the couple secured a contract to illustrate a series of articles for Century Magazine. For this endeavour the pair embarked on travel to North Africa, Spain and Portugal, visiting localities such as Tangier and Tétouan in Morocco, that had not been covered by any of the illustrated magazines at that time. In Europe they encountered the works of the Spanish realist, Mariano Fortuny and the French painter, Henri Regnault, and spent much of their time following in the artists' footsteps across Spain, France and Morocco. Between 1880 and 1890, the Champneys made several trips to Europe, and in 1890 Champney opened a studio in Paris.From around 1885 Champney focussed almost exclusively on pastels. He exhibited pastel works at the Columbian Exhibition in Chicago (1893, 1898). In 1882 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member. He was also a member of the Salmagundi Art Club.The Champney's marriage was a very happy one. In the midst of preparing for a trip to Russia, James died on 1 May 1903 in from a fall in a New York elevator shaft; the circumstances were reported in The New York Times. He was survived by his widow; a son, Édouard Frère Champney (b. 1874, France), an architect, of Washington; and a daughter, Mrs John Humphreys, known as Marie Champney (b. 1877), a painter of miniatures.

He started as a portrait painter and engraver (c.1830s-1850s), and at the age of 40 became involved in telescope making. Using glass blanks made by Chance Brothers of Birmingham and Feil-Mantois of Paris, his firm Alvan Clark & Sons ground lenses for refracting telescopes. Their lenses included the largest in the world at the time: the 18.5-inch (47 cm) at Dearborn Observatory at the Old University of Chicago (the lens was originally intended for Ole Miss), the two 26-inch (66 cm) telescopes at the United States Naval Observatory and McCormick Observatory, the 30-inch (76 cm) at Pulkovo Observatory (destroyed in the Siege of Leningrad; only the lens survives), the 36-inch (91 cm) telescope at Lick Observatory (still third-largest) and later the 40-inch (100 cm) at Yerkes Observatory, which remains the largest successful refracting telescope in the world.Although not specifically searching for double stars, he did make a number of discoveries while testing his completed telescope objectives, including Mu Herculis, 8 Sextantis, and 95 Ceti. One of Clark's sons, Alvan Graham Clark, discovered the dim companion of Sirius. Two craters bear Clark Sr.'s name. The crater Clark on the Moon is jointly named for him and his son, Alvan Graham Clark, and one on Mars is named in his honour.  His other son was George Bassett Clark; both sons were partners in the firm.Clark was also competitive in target shooting and received a patent for his device to allow bullets to be seated into a muzzle loading rifle without damage to either the bullet or the rifle's muzzle. Exclusive license to this patent (1,565 of April 24, 1840) was made to Edwin Wesson, brother of Daniel B. Wesson.In 1880, Clark was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

Thomas Cole	Question: question: Who is widely regarded as the first significant American landscape painter?	Ref: Cole	Pred: Thomas Cole	Context: Thomas Cole was an English-born American artist and the founder of the Hudson River School art movement. Cole is widely regarded as the first significant American landscape painter. He was known for his romantic landscape and history paintings. Influenced by European painters, but with a strong American sensibility, he was prolific throughout his career and worked primarily with oil on canvas. His paintings are typically allegoric and often depict small figures or structures set against moody and evocative natural landscapes. They are usually escapist, framing the New World as a natural eden contrasting with the smog-filled cityscapes of Industrial Revolution-era Britain, in which he grew up. His works, often seen as conservative, criticize the contemporary trends of industrialism, urbanism, and westward expansion.
Charlotte B. Coman	Question: question: Along with Jean-Baptiste Corot, who was a notable French Barbizon painter?	Ref: Charles-Francois Daubigny	Pred: Charles-Francois Daubigny	Context: Charlotte Buell Coman (1833 – November 11, 1924) was an American painter. Coman was born in Waterville, New York in 1833. She married and moved with her husband to Iowa City, then on the American Frontier, only to return to Waterville after his death a few years later. She began to suffer from hearing loss, and was almost completely deaf by the time she turned 40.Coman did not take up painting until she was in her mid 40s. She studied in New York with James Renwick Brevoort and in Paris with Harry Thompson and Émile Louis Vernier. With Vernier she studied plein-air and watercolor painting, and sketched on trips to rural parts of France and Holland. She was influenced by the French Barbizon painters, especially Jean-Baptiste Corot and Charles-Francois Daubigny, and her popular works were compared to those of Corot. Her artwork betrays a Barbizon-influenced preoccupation with the way that natural light is affected by time of day and weather conditions.After ten years spent abroad, Coman returned to New York and focused on painting American landscapes in the tonalist style. Her paintings were based on sketches made on trips to the Adirondacks, New Jersey, and Saint Augustine, Florida. She painted quiet, atmospheric landscapes with high horizon lines, often dominated by one muted color and using a heavy impasto. Her canvases are signed "C.B. Coman"; like many women artists of her era, she used her initials to conceal her gender.Coman showed two paintings at the National Academy of Design in 1875, and she showed her work often in New York and at the Paris Salons. She exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.In 1905 Coman received the Shaw Memorial Prize given by the Society of American Artists. She was elected an associate of the National Academy of Design in 1910. Coman was also a member of the  National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors, the New York Watercolor Club, and the Art Workers' Club.Coman continued sketching and painting until she was in her eighties. She died in Yonkers, New York in 1924.Her work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Arnot Art Museum. A portrait of her by Helen Watson Phelps is in the collection of the National Academy of Design.

George Hewitt Cushman	Question: question: Where was George Hewitt Cushman born?	Ref: New Jersey	Pred: Windham, Connecticut	Context: George Hewitt Cushman (June 5, 1814 in Windham, Connecticut – August 3, 1876 in Jersey City Heights, New Jersey) was a top American engraver and painter of miniature paintings and portraits of his time (second only to Edward Greene Malbone). He turned early to these professions after family financial misfortunes prevented him from entering West Point and becoming a soldier.He studied drawing under Washington Allston and line engraving with Asaph Willard and Seth and John Cheney (with whom he later shared a studio in Boston).In 1843 he moved to Philadelphia and resided there for twenty years, appearing in the city's directory as a miniature painting and portrait painter. In 1849 he married Susan Wetherill. While in Philadelphia he engraved printing plates for many books, including James Fenimore Cooper's novels' thirty-four volumes (1859–1861), the household edition of Charles Dickens (1861), and Frances S. Osgood's Poems (1850),  and portraits  including Young America in the Alps, Forrest in William Rounseville Alger's Life of Edwin Forrest (1877), and a portrait of Lord Byron entitled inter alia.He primarily engraved notes for state banks until the creation of the National Banking Act and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington D.C. caused him to retire from this work.In 1862 he moved to New York City and created miniature paintings and portraits until his death at a water cure. His funeral was held at Chalkley Hall in Frankford, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His self-portrait is reproduced in Anne Hollingsworth Wharton's Heirlooms in Miniatures (1898).His genius would have placed him atop most American miniature painters. His signed engravings were noted as being "executed with much taste and ability". Sara Jane Lippincott remarked that his miniatures "were always remarkable for purity and simplicity of character as well as tone". However his extreme modesty always precluded him from ever exhibiting his miniatures save only to his friends.In 1928 the New York Public Library displayed examples of his engravings in a presentation of the works of one hundred notable American engravers. A group of his miniatures were publicly displayed front and center at the Retrospective Exhibition of the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.== References ==

Elliott Daingerfield	Question: question: Where was Elliott Daingerfield born?	Ref: Harpers Ferry	Pred: Harpers Ferry, West Virginia	Context: Elliott Daingerfield (1859–1932) was an American artist who lived and worked in North Carolina. He is considered one of North Carolina's most prolific artists.Elliott, the son of a captain in the Confederate Army, was born in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and raised in Fayetteville, North Carolina. At 21, he moved to New York to study art and was apprenticed under Walter Satterlee in 1880. He became an instructor in Satterlee's still life class and studied at the Art Students' League.In 1884, Daingerfield left Satterlee and met George Inness. The works of Inness, Albert Pinkham Ryder, and Kenyon Cox "inspired his visionary style", according to the art historian Stephanie J. Fox. Daingerfield was also influenced by the European Symbolists whose work he encountered during his time studying in Europe c. 1897. In the late 1890s he achieved recognition for paintings of religious subjects, an example of which is his mural in the Church of Saint Mary the Virgin in New York City. In 1902, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an associate member; he became a full member in 1906.Daingerfield wrote a number of articles on art, including the essay "Nature versus Art" published in 1911 in Scribner's Magazine. He published a biography of George Inness in 1911, and a biography of Ralph Albert Blakelock in 1914. Daingerfield traveled to the American West in 1911 and 1913, and made seven paintings of the Grand Canyon.He married twice. His first wife, Roberta Strange French, died during childbirth in 1891. His second wife, Anna Grainger (married 1895), bore two daughters named Gwendoline and Marjorie.Elliott Daingerfield died in 1932 and is buried in Cross Creek Cemetery at Fayetteville.In 1971, the North Carolina Museum of Art displayed 200 of Daingerfield's paintings; the museum owns "Grand Canyon" and "Evening Glow."Heritage Square in Fayetteville exhibits Daingerfield's teenage home.

The second is a private residence. His third summer home and studio Westglow was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.
William Parsons Winchester Dana	Question: question: Who was William Parsons Winchester Dana?	Ref: Dana	Pred: An American artist.	Context: William Parsons Winchester Dana (18 February 1833 – 8 April 1927) was an American artist who settled in France. Later he emigrated to London, and became a naturalised British Subject. His paintings were generally small, painted with oils on canvas in an anglicized tradition. Dana's transatlanticism influenced Monet and the French impressionists, whom he met in Paris and Normandy. But his most enduring feature as an artist was a highly personalised, naturalistic style, intimate and affective of familiarity. Yet he remained very much in the romantic vein of older painters from an earlier period, essentially conservative, but observant of minute detail.
William Turner Dannat	Question: question: Who was the president of the Society of American Painters?	Ref: Dannat	Pred: William T. Dannat	Context: William Turner Dannat (July 9, 1853 – March 12, 1929) was an American artist known especially for paintings of Spanish subject matter. William T. Dannat was born in 1853 at Hempstead, New York the younger of two boys raised by William H. and Susan (née Jones) Dannat.  His father was a successful lumber dealer who, with Charles E. Pell, founded the firm Dannat and Pell. Later William's older brother David would succeed their father as a partner in the firm.When Dannat was around the age of twelve his parents decided to send him to Germany to further his education. He would later study architecture at Hanover and Stuttgart before choosing instead to become an artist. Dannat attended art classes at the Munich Royal Academy of Fine Arts and later under Mihály Munkácsy in Paris. Dannat became an accomplished draughtsman and a distinguished figure and portrait painter. He early attracted attention with sketches and pictures made in Spain. A large composition, The Quatuor Espagnol, that was displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, was one of the successes of the Paris Salon of 1884. Dannat later settled in Paris, where he taught at the Académie Julian. He was influenced by a number of masters including Carolus Duran and Munkácsy, though more by the latter as can be observed in his paintings Contrebandier Aragonais and Quatuor Espagnol.Though at one time his name was mentioned alongside other great American painters such as Sargent and Whistler, Dannat's popularity was more in Europe than his homeland. As he approached middle age the financially secure artist began to devote more and more of his time to other interests: fencing, boxing and later automobile racing. For nearly twenty years Dannat ceased painting and when he resumed around 1913 his art had adopted a more surrealistic style with illusionary landscapes and bizarre themes. During his hiatus from painting Dannat spent much of his time touring Europe studying the techniques of the great masters while remaining active in artistic circles in Paris where he served at one time as the president of the Society of American Painters.William Turner Dannat died in 1929, aged 75, while at Monte Carlo.== References ==
Arthur Bowen Davies	Question: question: Where did Arthur Bowen Davies briefly attend?	Ref: Art Institute of Chicago	Pred: Art Institute of Chicago	Context: Arthur Bowen Davies (September 26, 1862 – October 24, 1928) was an avant-garde American artist and influential advocate of modern art in the United States c. 1910–1928. Davies was born in Utica, New York, the son of David and Phoebe Davies. He was keenly interested in drawing when he was young and, at fifteen, attended a large touring exhibition in his hometown of American landscape art, featuring works by George Inness and members of the Hudson River School.  The show had a profound effect on him. He was especially impressed by Inness's tonalist landscapes. After his family relocated to Chicago, Davies studied at the Chicago Academy of Design from 1879 to 1882 and briefly attended the Art Institute of Chicago, before moving to New York City, where he studied at the Art Students League. He worked as a magazine illustrator before devoting himself to painting.In 1892, Davies married Virginia Meriwether, one of New York State's first female physicians. Her family, suspecting that their daughter might end by being the sole breadwinner of the family if she was to marry an impoverished artist, insisted that the bridegroom sign a prenuptial agreement, renouncing any claim on his wife's money in the event of divorce. (Davies would eventually become very wealthy through the sale of his paintings, though his prospects at thirty did not look encouraging.)  Appearances notwithstanding, they were anything but a conventional couple, even aside from the fact that Davies was of a philandering nature. Virginia had eloped when she was young and had murdered her husband on her honeymoon when she discovered that he was an abusive drug addict and compulsive gambler, a fact that she and her family kept from Davies.  When Davies died in 1928, Virginia discovered that he had kept hidden a second life, with another common-law wife, Edna, and family. Edna discovered that she was given a subsistence allowance by Arthur, despite his financial success as an artist.An urbane man with a formal demeanor, Arthur B. Davies was "famously diffident and retiring".  He would rarely invite anyone to his studio and, later in life, would go out of his way to avoid old friends and acquaintances. The reason for Davies' reticence became known after his sudden death while vacationing in Italy in 1928: he had two wives (one legal, one common-law) and children by each of them, a secret kept from Virginia for twenty-five years. With Virginia, he had two sons, Niles and Arthur.

A pupil of the schools of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, he was sent to Paris in 1880. Having studied at the Académie Julian under Jules Joseph Lefebvre and Gustave Boulanger, he went to Barbizon and painted much in the forest of Fontainebleau under the traditions of the men of thirty.In 1890, Davis returned to the U.S., settling in Mystic, Connecticut. He shifted to Impressionism in his style, and took up the cloudscapes for which he became best-known. He eventually became a leading figure in the art colony that had developed in Mystic, and founded the Mystic Art Association in 1913.He became a full member of the National Academy of Design in 1906, and received many awards, including a silver medal at the Paris Exhibition of 1889.He is represented by important works in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington; the Pennsylvania Academy, Philadelphia, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts.
Jane Anthony Davis	Question: question: Where was Jane Anthony Davis born?	Ref: Rhode Island	Pred: Warwick, Rhode Island	Context: Jane Anthony Davis (September 2, 1821 – April 1855) was an American artist. Until 1981 she was known only as J. A. Davis.Davis was born Jane Anthony in Warwick, Rhode Island, the daughter of Giles Anthony and Sara Robinson Greene. In 1838, she briefly attended the Warren Ladies Seminary (in Rhode Island). She married Edward Nelson Davis of Norwich, Connecticut on February 1, 1841, and lived with him in that town for a time. On January 10, 1842, she gave birth to a child. The family moved to Providence, Rhode Island; there she gave birth to another child, her second, on April 26, 1847. In August 1854 she produced her last portrait, of Luella Hodges. She died of tuberculosis eight months later, and was buried in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence.It was common for women artists of the era to sign their work using only their initials, and Davis was no different in this regard; consequently, it was for many years assumed that she was male. In 1981, collectors Sybil and Arthur Kern identified the artist by name, further confirming their identification with two later reports. She produced miniature portraits, working in watercolor and pencil. Most of Davis's subjects are depicted in three-quarter view, at bust length. Often they are clothed in black. Several characteristics appear in many of her depictions: a ragged part in the hair, bluish coloring of the eyelids, a wide and colored horizontal band below the bust, and negative space between the subject's arms and body. The artist sometimes incorporated flowers into her compositions. Many pieces were signed and dated; some also included the subject's name. Davis is known to have produced over 200 portraits, mostly of residents of the areas in which she lived. Three of her unsigned pieces were at one time mistakenly attributed to James Ellsworth, and later to Alexander Emmons; three others were mistakenly attributed to Joseph H. Davis and Eben Davis.An undated portrait by Davis, Lady Seated in a Boston Rocker, is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Another piece, a family portrait, appeared on Antiques Roadshow in 2003, where it was appraised at between $25,000 and $35,000.== References ==

Joseph Decker	Question: question: Who did Decker begin to paint landscapes under?	Ref: George Inness	Pred: George Inness	Context: Joseph Decker (1853 – 1 April 1924) was a German-born American painter who specialized in still-lifes. His subjects were mostly of edible, rather than man-made objects. He was born in Württemberg, Germany. His father was a carpenter. At the age of fourteen, in 1867, he and his family emigrated to the United States. At first, he was apprenticed to a house painter in Brooklyn, then worked painting signs. By the mid 1870s, he had aspirations to become a serious artist and began taking drawing classes at the National Academy of Design. It is believed that his primary teacher there was John George Brown. In a few years, he was exhibiting portraits and landscapes at the Brooklyn Art Association. He was able to save enough money to travel to Munich in 1879, where he spent a year studying with the history painter, Wilhelm Lindenschmit.Upon returning, he exhibited at the National Academy, the Brooklyn Art Association, the Society of American Artists, and the Art Institute of Chicago. He established a studio in Manhattan in the mid 1880s. In 1889 he exhibited at the International Industrial Fair in Buffalo. After that, he stopped exhibiting and began to paint landscapes; possibly under the influence of George Inness. At that time, his works also became softer in tone. In addition to still-lifes, he created genre scenes, portraits and novelties which incorporated the shape of the artist's palette, including the finger-hole. Later he worked for the well-known art collector (and his primary patron), Thomas B. Clarke; restoring porcelains.He had a wife and five children, but spent long periods in Germany by himself. He was, however, fond of animals and included his pet squirrel, Bonnie, in some of his paintings. His last years are mostly undocumented and he died in the charity ward of a Brooklyn hospital in 1924. His work was forgotten until Alfred Frankenstein, the art historian, called attention to it in 1949. William H. Gerdts, also an art historian, has pointed out similarities between some of Decker's paintings and the illustrations on seed packets made in Rochester, New York, at about the same time.

Although he produced figural sculpture, bas reliefs and paintings, his fame rests primarily on a single bronze sculpture, "The Young Sophocles".  This bronze was originally cast in 1885, but later castings are known to exist.

Robert Seldon Duncanson	Question: question: Who is considered the first African-American artist to be internationally known?	Ref: Duncanson	Pred: Duncanson	Context: Robert Seldon Duncanson (1821 – December 21, 1872) was a 19th-century American landscapist of European and African ancestry. Inspired by famous American landscape artists like Thomas Cole, Duncanson created renowned landscape paintings and is considered a second generation Hudson River School artist. Duncanson spent the majority of his career in Cincinnati, Ohio and helped develop the Ohio River Valley landscape tradition. As a free black man in antebellum America, Duncanson engaged the abolitionist community in America and England to support and promote his work. Duncanson is considered the first African-American artist to be internationally known. He operated in the cultural circles of Cincinnati, Detroit, Montreal, and London. The primary art historical debate centered on Duncanson concerns the role that contemporary racial issues played in his work. Some art historians, like Joseph D. Ketner, believe that Duncanson used racial metaphors in his artwork, while others, like Margaret Rose Vendryes, discourage viewers from approaching his art with a racialized perspective.
William Dunlap	Question: question: Where was William Dunlap's Rockingham?	Ref: Rocky Hill	Pred: Rocky Hill	Context: William Dunlap (February 19, 1766 – September 28, 1839) was a pioneer of American theater. He was a producer, playwright, and actor, as well as a historian. He managed two of New York City's earliest and most prominent theaters, the John Street Theatre (from 1796–98) and the Park Theatre (from 1798–1805). He was also an artist, despite losing an eye in childhood.He was born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, the son of an army officer wounded at the Battle of Quebec in 1759. In 1783, he painted a portrait of George Washington, while staying at Rockingham in Rocky Hill. The painting is now owned by the United States Senate. He later studied art under Benjamin West in London. Another teacher was Abraham Delanoy, with whom he had a handful of lessons in New York. After returning to America in 1787, he worked exclusively in the theater for 18 years, resuming painting out of economic necessity in 1805. By 1817, he was a full-time painter.In his lifetime he produced more than sixty plays, most of which were adaptations or translations from French or German works. A few were original: these were based on American themes and had American characters.  However, he is best known for his encyclopedic three-volume History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United States, which was published in 1834, and which is now an invaluable source of information about artists, collecting, and artistic life generally in the colonial and federal periods.His plays include: The Father (1789)Andre (1798)The Stranger (1798)The Italian Father (1799)False Shame (1799)The Virgin of the Sun (1800)The Glory of Columbia, Her Yeomanry (1803)Memoirs of George Frederick Cooke (1813)A Trip to Niagara (1828)In 1825 Dunlap was one of the founders of the National Academy of Design, and taught at its school.

John Vanderlyn	Question: question: Where did Aaron Burr send Vanderlyn to?	Ref: Paris	Pred: Paris	Context: John Vanderlyn (October 18, 1775 – September 23, 1852) was an American neoclassicist painter. Vanderlyn was born at Kingston, New York, and was the grandson of colonial portrait painter Pieter Vanderlyn. He was employed by a print-seller in New York, and was first instructed in art by Archibald Robinson (1765–1835), a Scotsman who was afterwards one of the directors of the American Academy of the Fine Arts. He went to Philadelphia, where he spent time in the studio of Gilbert Stuart and copied some of Stuart's portraits, including one of Aaron Burr, who placed him under Gilbert Stuart as a pupil.He was a protégé of Aaron Burr who in 1796 sent Vanderlyn to Paris, where he studied for five years.  He returned to the United States in 1801 and lived in the home of Burr, then the Vice President, where he painted the well-known portraits of Burr and his daughter. In 1802 he painted two views of Niagara Falls, which were engraved and published in London in 1804. He returned to Paris in 1803, also visiting England in 1805, where he painted the Death of Jane McCrea for Joel Barlow. Vanderlyn then went to Rome, where he painted his picture of Marius amid the Ruins of Carthage, which was shown in Paris, and obtained the Napoleon gold medal there. This success caused him to remain in Paris for seven years, during which time he prospered greatly. In 1812 he showed a nude Ariadne (engraved by Durand, and now in the Pennsylvania Academy), which increased his fame. When Aaron Burr fled to Paris, Vanderlyn was for a time his only support.Vanderlyn returned to the United States in 1815, and painted portraits of various eminent men, including James Monroe, John C. Calhoun, Governor Joseph C. Yates, Governor George Clinton, James Madison, Robert R Livingston (New York Historical Society), Andrew Jackson, and Zachary Taylor. In 1834, he completed a posthumous full-length portrait of George Washington for the U.S. House of Representatives, based on Gilbert Stuart's 1796 Lansdowne portrait.He also exhibited panoramas and built The Rotunda in New York City, which displayed panoramas of Paris, Athens, Mexico, Versailles (by himself), and some battle-pieces; but neither his portraits nor the panoramas brought him financial success, partly because he worked very slowly.In 1825 Vanderlyn was one of the founders of the National Academy of Design, and taught at its school.In 1842, through friendly influences, he was commissioned by Congress to paint The Landing of Columbus for the Rotunda of the United States Capitol. Going to Paris, he hired a French artist, who, it is said, did most of the work. It was engraved for the United States five-dollar banknotes. This painting was later reproduced in an engraving used on the Columbian 2c Postage Issue of 1893.Vanderlyn was the first American to study in France instead of in England, and to acquire accurate draughtsmanship. He was more academic than his fellows; but, though faithfully and capably executed, it was thought that his work was rather devoid of charm, according to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica. His Landing of Columbus has been called by Appleton's Cyclopedia "hardly more than respectable."He died in poverty at Kingston, New York, on September 23, 1852. He is buried in Wiltwyck Rural Cemetery in Kingston, NY.

Thomas Eakins	Question: question: What nationality was Thomas Cowperthwait Eakins?	Ref: American	Pred: American	Context: Thomas Cowperthwait Eakins (; July 25, 1844 – June 25, 1916) was an American realist painter, photographer, sculptor, and fine arts educator. He is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important American artists.For the length of his professional career, from the early 1870s until his health began to fail some 40 years later, Eakins worked exactingly from life, choosing as his subject the people of his hometown of Philadelphia. He painted several hundred portraits, usually of friends, family members, or prominent people in the arts, sciences, medicine, and clergy. Taken en masse, the portraits offer an overview of the intellectual life of contemporary Philadelphia of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.In addition, Eakins produced a number of large paintings that brought the portrait out of the drawing room and into the offices, streets, parks, rivers, arenas, and surgical amphitheaters of his city. These active outdoor venues allowed him to paint the subject that most inspired him: the nude or lightly clad figure in motion. In the process, he could model the forms of the body in full sunlight, and create images of deep space utilizing his studies in perspective. Eakins took keen interest in new motion photography, a field in which he is now seen as an innovator.Eakins was also an educator, and his instruction was a highly influential presence in American art. The difficulties he encountered as an artist were seeking to paint portraits and figures realistically as behavioral and sexual scandals truncated his success and challenged his reputation.Eakins was a controversial figure whose work received little recognition during his lifetime. Since his death, he has been celebrated by American art historians as "the strongest, most profound realist in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century American art".

Henry Farrer	Question: question: Who was the younger brother of Thomas Charles Farrer?	Ref: Henry Farrer	Pred: Henry Farrer	Context: Henry Farrer (March 23, 1844 – February 24, 1903) was an English-born American artist known for his tonalist watercolor landscapes and etchings. Farrer was born in London, the younger brother of artist Thomas Charles Farrer. Thomas had studied in Britain under John Ruskin and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Henry was self-taught, and may have aligned his style with that of his older brother.Farrer immigrated to America in 1863 and opened a studio in New York. As a newcomer to the American art world, he became a member of the Society for the Advancement of Truth in Art, a short-lived organization co-founded by his brother and centered on the Pre-Raphaelite tradition of truthful and highly realistic artistic depictions. In his first years as a professional artist in the 1860s, Farrer painted Pre-Raphaelite still lives, some landscapes and marine works, and also began his first efforts at etching.In the 1870s, Farrer's landscape work shifted to the tonalist style for which he is best remembered. He co-founded the American Watercolor Society and, unlike most artists of the time, painted in water colours almost exclusively. His tonalist landscapes, which he continued to create into the 1890s, typically depict a misty or cloudy landscape with a marsh or small pond in the foreground. The sun is often setting in a Farrer painting, and the overall feeling one of stillness. His use of subdued, earthy colors gives his works a meditative mood.During the same period, Farrer became a driving force in the Etching Revival in America. He was a founding member of the New York Etching Club in 1877, and active in the promotion of etching as a creative medium rather than a reproductive one. Farrer's best known etchings depict New York. He etched a series of street scenes in the 1860s, and another series of New York Harbor scenes in the late 1870s and 1880s.Farrer is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.== References ==

In the 1840s, the family settled in Greenwich Village in New York, where Field exhibited a few paintings and is thought to have taken up the new art of photography.  He learned from David Acheson Woodward to use the latter's 1857 solar camera to make enlargements from collodion negatives of portraits onto photo-sensitized canvas which he would over-paint in oils.He remained in New York for about seven years before relocating to Sunderland, Massachusetts to manage his ailing father's farm. From about 1847 Field embarked on a new phase of his artistic career, creating landscapes and history paintings, as photography began to supplant painting as the preferred medium for portraiture.Following the death of his wife in 1859, Field and his daughter moved to the settlement of Plumtrees in Sunderland, where he built a studio and continued to paint biblical scenes and Romantic landscapes. From the end of the Civil War he painted mostly historical and patriotic works. His best-known work, the Historical Monument of the American Republic, is a fantastical architectural image of key aspects of American history, inspired by plans for the Centennial Exposition to be held in 1876.  Field began work on the large canvas in 1867 and was still adding to it as late as 1888.Field died at Plumtrees, Sunderland, on June 28, 1900.All together, over 300 surviving works are attributed to Field.

John F. Francis	Question: question: Where was John F. Francis born?	Ref: Pennsylvania	Pred: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania	Context: John F. Francis (August 13, 1808 – November 15, 1886) was an American painter, primarily of still lifes. Francis was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Predominantly self-taught as an artist, he worked until 1845 as a portrait painter in central and eastern Pennsylvania. Francis's portraits reveal his early fascination with minute detail. In 1845 Francis began exhibiting his works at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Philadelphia Art Union; both museums promoted American artists by awarding paintings to subscribers using lottery-like drawings. It was in this period that he began to concentrate on still lifes, which had been established as a popular genre in Philadelphia by Raphaelle Peale and other painters.His first known still life is dated 1850, and by 1854 he had ceased to paint anything else. Francis became known as a leading painter of luncheon and dessert still lifes, developing an intricate vocabulary of forms required by his specialized subject. William H. Gerdts writes, "Of all the mid-century still-life specialists, Francis was the most painterly. There is often a freshness and a brio to his paint application that successfully balance his sure delineation of form and his establishment of texture."Nearly all of his paintings depict fruits and desserts. He painted many replicas of his works, with his style displaying little change over the course of his career. According to art historian Alfred Frankenstein, "his blond, high-keyed palette always provides one of the most distinctive accents in a general exhibition of American still life". Few of his paintings can be dated after 1872, and none after 1880. He was for the most part forgotten by the time of his death in Jeffersonville, West Norriton, in 1886.In 2013 a pair of his still lifes was appraised at $100,000.

John Wesley Jarvis	Question: question: Who was the great, great nephew of Methodist leader John Wesley?	Ref: John Wesley Jarvis	Pred: John Wesley Jarvis	Context: John Wesley Jarvis (1780 or 1781 – January 14, 1839) was an American painter. John Wesley Jarvis (great, great nephew of Methodist leader John Wesley), was born at South Shields, England. His father was an English mariner, who moved his family to the United States in the mid-1780s.  The Jarvis family settled in Philadelphia; there he spent his childhood and began his artistic training. He is known to have frequented the studio of the aging colonial-era portrait painter Matthew Pratt and he knew the Danish painter Christian Gullager. His formal instruction began around 1796, when he became apprenticed to Edward Savage. He also spent times with David Edwin, an English engraver also employed by Savage.Jarvis moved to New York in 1801 with Edward Savage.  Within a year he was working on his own as an engraver. In 1803 he entered into a partnership with Joseph Wood.  His partnership with Wood lasted seven years. Together they executed engravings, miniatures, and larger portraits. Jarvis had learned the technique of miniature painting from Edward Malbone; and by the time of the Jarvis/Wood partnership, he was also producing his first oil paintings. In addition, he operated a drawing school and executed inexpensive silhouette portraits.  In New York City he enjoyed great popularity, though his conviviality and eccentric mode of life affected his work. He visited Baltimore, Charleston, and New Orleans, entertaining much and painting portraits of prominent people, particularly in New Orleans, where General Andrew Jackson was one of his sitters. Isaac Collins, the New York City printer, became a favorite subject for Jarvis to sketch a portrait of in 1806. He had for assistants at different times both Thomas Sully and Henry Inman. He affected singularity in dress and manners, and his mots were the talk of the day.In 1809, Jarvis married Betsy Burtis (who died four years later in 1813, leaving him with two children). He parted with his family in order to seek portrait commissions in Baltimore. Although he made occasional trips back to New York, he remained in Baltimore for several years. While New York always remained his home base, he continued his habit of extended residences in other cities for most of the rest of his life. During the 1820s and 30s, for example, he sought work in South Carolina, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Washington, Virginia, Ohio, and Georgia. His apprentice, Henry Inman, probably accompanied him on these trips until his term of service ended in 1822.Jarvis rose to the top of his profession by 1814, when he took over an unprecedented commission for six full-length portraits of the naval heroes of the War of 1812 for the City of New York. (Gilbert Stuart had given up the important project after a dispute with the patrons). For over a decade, he remained the premier portrait painter in New York, with important ties to the political, mercantile, and cultural elite. Jarvis was also something of a social outsider, known for his ostentatious dress, flippant manner, and propensity to consume alcohol. He was celebrated as a hilarious storyteller, and his ties to the theater world were many.As early as the 1820s, however, he received some personal setbacks. In 1823 he was sued successfully by his apprentice John Quidor for breach of contract, and the following year he lost custody of his children in a court battle with his estranged second wife. A decade later, in 1834, he suffered a debilitating stroke while in New Orleans. Partially paralyzed and mentally incapacitated, he spent the rest of his life in New York City, cared for by his sister. He died there in 1839, in poverty.Examples of his painting are in the collections of the New York Historical Society, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Robert Fulton	Question: question: What state did William Henry live in?	Ref: Pennsylvania	Pred: Pennsylvania	Context: Robert Fulton (November 14, 1765 – February 24, 1815) was an American engineer and inventor who is widely credited with developing the world's first commercially successful steamboat, the North River Steamboat (also known as Clermont). In 1807, that steamboat traveled on the Hudson River with passengers from New York City to Albany and back again, a round trip of 300 nautical miles (560 kilometers), in 62 hours. The success of his steamboat changed river traffic and trade on major American rivers.In 1800, Fulton had been commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte, leader of France, to attempt to design a submarine; he produced Nautilus, the first practical submarine in history. Fulton is also credited with inventing some of the world's earliest naval torpedoes for use by the Royal Navy.Fulton became interested in steam engines and the idea of steamboats in 1777 when he was around age 12 and visited state delegate William Henry of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who was interested in this topic. Henry had learned about inventor James Watt and his Watt steam engine on an earlier visit to England.

Garrett was born in Albany, New York on October 19, 1853.  While little is known of his initial art education, Garrett rose through the ranks to become a distinguished member of the Boston Art Club and the Copley Society of Art, and was an acquaintance and colleague of renowned impressionist artist Childe Hassam. He studied at the Académie Julian in Paris under Gustave Boulanger, Jules Lefebvre, John Paul Laurens, and Hector Leroux.  After residing in Paris for approximately five years, he returned to America to establish a successful studio in Boston.His first original wood engraving was created in 1879 under the tutelage of Robert Swain Gifford. His first original prints specialized in both architectural views and landscapes, with his later etchings mostly featuring areas around Boston.Garrett provided the chief influence for Childe Hassam's first study trip to Europe in July 1883.  On June 30, 1883, Garrett and Hassam sailed to Europe aboard the SS Anchoria, then travelled for several months throughout Great Britain, The Netherlands, France, Italy, Switzerland and Spain studying paintings from the old masters and creating watercolors of the European countryside.  In late August 1883, both Garrett and Hassam sailed aboard the SS Alsatia to several Spanish ports before crossing the Atlantic back home.After they both returned to Boston, Garrett resumed his illustration work for various publishers, which was very much in demand, keeping him from spending energy on his watercolors.  During this time, Garrett worked at a studio located  at 12 West Street in Boston, which he shared with Hassam and fellow-artist Charles Henry Turner.In 1884, Garrett exhibited two watercolors at the Pennsylvania Academy ("A Street in Granada" and "El Mirador de la Reina, Alhambra") in 1884.  He also exhibited "A Street in Granada" at the "Third Annual Exhibition of the Paint and Clay Club," which was held at the Gallery of the Boston Art Club in March 1884.During the last two decades of the nineteenth century, Edmund Garrett's paintings and etchings were widely exhibited throughout the United States and in France at the Paris Salon.During his lifetime, Garrett was a prolific illustrator of many books and publications, including various books of poetry by Tennyson, Keats, and Schiller; the Legends of King Arthur; Austen's Pride & Prejudice; Marie Louise de la Ramée's (Ouida's) A Dog of Flanders; stories by Alexandre Dumas; various books of Elizabethan and Victorian songs; and other books by Longfellow, Sir Walter Scott, Shelley, Wordsworth, and Hawthorne, among others.Today, Garrett's works adorn the walls of the Art Institute of Chicago, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the New York Public Library, the Boston Public Library, and the Massachusetts State House.  Other works appear in collections at the Public Library in Winchester, Mass; Calumet Club (Boston, Mass.), Brookside Library; Conant Memorial Church; and the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco.Garrett died in Needham, Massachusetts on April 2, 1929.

Ives Gammell says  "She had a flair for picking the revealing gesture which expressed her sitter and then offsetting its dominant lines with aptly chosen surroundings so as to create a tapestry of shapes and colors which enchant the eye. Her portraits charm us as decorative wall hangings in the same degree that they fascinate as revelations of character.  This twofold triumph is especially noteworthy in her portrayals of children." And in a review in the Boston Globe of an exhibit that included some of her works, Christine Temin stated, "Her drawings are veiled in a soft haze, the product of a technique based on thousands of wispy vertical strokes. While other figures in this show trumpet their importance, gazing assertively at the viewer, the women in Hale's drawings are caught in intimate, contemplative moments. And while other interiors in the show are stuffed with Oriental porcelain and fine antiques, Hale's untitled 1930 room featuring a multi-paned window casting geometric shadows on the floor, has a Shaker simplicity. " Her work is associated with the Boston School of American Impressionism.In 1927, Hale won an Altman Prize from the National Academy of Design.Her work is in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the National Academy of Design, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Phillips Collection, the North Carolina Museum of Art, and The Cleveland Museum of Art. [1] Her work was also part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.Her papers are held with the Hale Family Papers at Smith College.

Beginning in 1887, he studied in Paris for five years, and during the summers painted at Giverny, where he was influenced by the palette and brushwork of Claude Monet. In the 1890s he painted his most experimental works, which evidenced an interest in Neo-impressionism and Symbolism.Hale returned to Boston in 1893. Formerly engaged to Ethel Reed, he instead married fellow artist Lilian Westcott Hale in 1902, and they rented adjoining studios in Boston. Hale taught at the Museum School in Boston, as well as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts; among his Boston pupils was Mary Bradish Titcomb.

Pop Hart	Question: question: Where did Hart work for the film industry?	Ref: New Jersey	Pred: New Jersey	Context: George Overbury "Pop" Hart (1868–1933) was an early 20th century American painter and watercolorist. Hart was born in Cairo, Illinois, the eldest of four children, and raised in Rochester, New York. His father managed a printing roller factory, and Hart worked there for a time in his teens but lost the job due to an explosion that took place when he was off sketching instead of watching the glue vats. Around the age of 18, he went to London on a cattle boat and while in England became an itinerant sign painter to support himself. Eventually he landed in Chicago, where he worked for a while as an illustrator for a newspaper and also as a sign painter for the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 and other clients. Although Hart was initially self-taught, in the 1890s he attended the Chicago Art Institute on and off for several years, and in 1907 he spent a year at the Académie Julien in Paris.For the first few years of the 20th century, Hart traveled all over the world: to Mexico, Central America, North Africa, the Caribbean, and the South Pacific, where he visited Tahiti in 1903, shortly after the death of Gauguin. Following his 1907 studies in Paris, he supported himself for about five years by working as a sign painter around New York City, and then he worked for most of a decade painting sets for the nascent film industry in New Jersey. He set up a studio in Coytesville, a neighborhood in Fort Lee, New Jersey, but he spent much of the 1920s traveling again.Hart is said to have acquired his nickname of "Pop" after growing a beard during one of his many trips, and thereafter many of his works appear with the signature "Pop Hart". He died in 1933 in Coytesville, where he had lived in poor health during his last years.

Rufus Hathaway	Question: question: What was Rufus Hathaway's title before his death?	Ref: Honorary Fellow	Pred: Honorary Fellow of the Massachusetts Medical Society	Context: Rufus Hathaway (1770–1822) was an American physician and folk art painter.  He lived in southern Massachusetts, where he painted numerous portraits between 1790 and 1795.  He later studied medicine and established himself as a doctor at Duxbury.Hathway was born in Freetown, Massachusetts, and was the eldest of six children born to Asa Hathaway and Mary Phillips; his father and grandfather were ship carpenters. The family moved several times, settling in Bristol, Rhode Island in the mid-1780s.  The source of Hathaway's artistic training is unknown, though it is believed he may have worked as a decorative artist or apprentice ship-carver; as a painter he appears to have been self-taught.  He is known to have been active in the vicinity of Taunton, Massachusetts in 1790.  Hathaway arrived in Duxbury in 1791, and began painting portraits of members of locally prominent families.  In 1795 he married Judith Winsor, the daughter of a locally important merchant.  He took up medicine at this time, possibly at the behest of his new wife's family, studying with Dr. Isaac Winslow of Marshfield.  He seems to have abandoned painting, as very few works by his hand are known after the time of his marriage, although paintings dating to as late as 1808 have been documented. Hathaway had twelve children by Judith; at one time the only physician in Duxbury, he was highly respected in the field, and was elected Honorary Fellow of the Massachusetts Medical Society shortly before his death.  One of his granddaughters was the abolitionist and suffragist Judith Winsor Smith, and surgeon Frederick Winsor was a great-nephew.Thirty-three portraits by Hathaway are known to exist, dating almost exclusively to the years between 1790 and 1795; all are of relatives and friends, among them the educator and politician George Partridge. He also painted landscapes, portrait miniatures, and overmantels.  One genre painting, the Welch Curate of about 1800, is documented; it was adapted from an English mezzotint.  Furthermore, he is known to have created at least one wood carving, a figure of an eagle used to crown a temporary arch constructed to inaugurate a new bridge over the Bluefish River, and he carved the frames to some of his paintings.Hathaway died of a hernia incurred while lifting a patient, traditionally held to be Ezra Weston, and is buried in the Mayflower Cemetery in Duxbury. His epitaph, which he may have composed himself, relates to his career as a physician. He was survived by Judith, who would go on to live to be 102, and left his heirs a little more than 700 pounds at his death.A bill of sale for six portraits of the Weston family exists, dating to 1793; it indicates that the paintings cost six pounds, and that Hathaway charged a further three shillings for the frame on the portrait of Ezra Weston.  In 2006, a pair of portraits, of Josiah Dean III and his wife, Sarah, were sold at Sotheby's, together fetching $380,000.

After graduation she taught at a girls' boarding school, saving up enough money to go to Paris and spend two summers at the Académie Colarossi. She received training in the creation of full-scale portraits, but soon found that she preferred the challenge of working in miniature.Almost immediately upon the start of her career Hawley began to receive awards.  Throughout her career, these included a medal of honor from the Pennsylvania Society of Miniature Painters (1918); the Lea Prize from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts (1920); the Smith Memorial Prize of the Baltimore Watercolor Club (1925); a bronze medal at the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia (1926); a medal of honor from the Brooklyn Society of Miniature Painters (1931); and a medal for best miniature from the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors (1931).

Her only listed survivors were her sister and two stepsisters. She is buried in the Foote-Ward Cemetery in Guilford, Connecticut.== References ==
Charles Webster Hawthorne	Question: question: Who founded the Cape Cod School of Art?	Ref: Charles Webster Hawthorne	Pred: Charles Webster Hawthorne	Context: Charles Webster Hawthorne (January 8, 1872 – November 29, 1930) was an American portrait and genre painter and a noted teacher who founded the Cape Cod School of Art in 1899.He was born in Lodi, Illinois, and his parents returned to Maine, raising him in the state where Charles' father was born. At age 18, he went to New York, working as an office-boy by day in a stained-glass factory and studying at night school and with Henry Siddons Mowbray and William Merritt Chase, and abroad in both the Netherlands and Italy. In 1908 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1911. [He studied painting under several notable artists] at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League. Among his teachers were Frank Vincent DuMond and George de Forest Brush. But Hawthorne declared that the most dominant influence in his career was William Merritt Chase, with whom he worked as both a pupil and assistant. Both men were naturally talented teachers and figurative painters who were drawn to rich color and the lusciousness of oil paint as a medium. Chase passed on a Munich tradition of tone values and tone painting, and Hawthorne learned all he could.While studying abroad in the Netherlands as Chase's assistant, Hawthorne was influenced to start his own school of art.His winters were spent in Paris and New York City, his summers at Provincetown, Massachusetts, the site of his school. In addition to founding the Cape Cod School of Art, Hawthorne was also a founding member of the Provincetown Art Association established in 1914. While in Paris Hawthorne became a full member of the French Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1917.The Cape Cod School of Art was the first outdoor summer school for figure painting and grew into one of the nation's leading art schools. Under thirty years of Hawthorne's guidance, the school attracted some of the most talented art instructors and students in the country including John Noble, Richard Miller, and Max Bohm. At his school, Hawthorne gave weekly criticisms and instructive talks, guiding his pupils and setting up ideals but never imposing his own technique or method.Another well known student was Norman Rockwell, who studied with Hawthorne one summer while he was enrolled at the Art Students League.  William H. Johnson also studied with Hawthorne and later got a grant from him. Another pupil was Bertha Noyes, long an important figure in the artistic scene of Washington, D.C.Among his works:  The Trousseau, Metropolitan Museum of ArtMother and Child, Syracuse MuseumNet Mender, Rhode Island School of Design, ProvidenceVenetian Girl, Worcester Art MuseumThe Family, Buffalo Fine Arts AcademyCrew of the Philomena Manta, 1915, Provincetown Art CollectionFish Cleaners, Provincetown Art CollectionUntitled (Study of girl in white), 1927, Provincetown Art CollectionGirl in Yellow Scarf, 1904, Butler Institute of American Art, Youngstown, OhioThe Fisherman's Daughter, Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.The Fish and the Man, 1925 (larger image), Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, TexasHis class studio in Provincetown on Miller Hill Road (currently known as the Hawthorne School of Art) was added August 21, 1978, to the National Register of Historic Places.

Martin Johnson Heade	Question: question: What school did Martin Johnson Heade belong to?	Ref: Hudson River School	Pred: The Hudson River School.	Context: Martin Johnson Heade (August 11, 1819 – September 4, 1904) was an American painter known for his salt marsh landscapes, seascapes, and depictions of tropical birds (such as hummingbirds), as well as lotus blossoms and other still lifes. His painting style and subject matter, while derived from the romanticism of the time, are regarded by art historians as a significant departure from those of his peers.Heade was born in Lumberville, Pennsylvania, the son of a storekeeper. He studied with Edward Hicks, and possibly with Thomas Hicks. His earliest works were produced during the 1840s and were chiefly portraits. He travelled to Europe several times as a young man, became an itinerant artist on American shores, and exhibited in Philadelphia in 1841 and New York in 1843. Friendships with artists of the Hudson River School led to an interest in landscape art.  In 1863, he planned to publish a volume of Brazilian hummingbirds and tropical flowers, but the project was eventually abandoned. He travelled to the tropics several times thereafter, and continued to paint birds and flowers. Heade married in 1883 and moved to St. Augustine, Florida. His chief works from this period were Floridian landscapes and flowers, particularly magnolias laid upon velvet cloth. He died in 1904. His best known works are depictions of light and shadow upon the salt marshes of New England.Heade was not a widely known artist during his lifetime, but his work attracted the notice of scholars, art historians, and collectors during the 1940s. He quickly became recognized as a major American artist. Although often considered a Hudson River School artist, some critics and scholars take exception to this categorization. Heade's works are now in major museums and collections. His paintings are occasionally discovered in unlikely places such as garage sales and flea markets.

At Athens he and his wife, Frances Maria Mulligan Hill (1799-1884), who he had married in 1821, established schools for girls and boys. These were the first Athenian schools founded after Greece's secession from the Ottoman Empire.Also part of their mission was John J. Robertson, an Episcopal clergyman.  He set up a printing press. The Greek government eventually founded a school for boys, and the Hills decided to devote their attention to educating girls.In their educational work, the Hills made no effort to promote their own church, but were careful to work with the Greek Orthodox Church and the government, by which they were officially recognized in 1834. The Hills also founded a high school for the training of teachers. Their work at first received little encouragement, but prospered after pupils from prominent and wealthy Greek families began to attend the school.Hill was chaplain of the British Legation in Greece from 1845 to 1875, and continued his teaching during that time. He and his wife also founded a free school for the poor. He went blind around 1877, but with his wife's assistance continued to direct their educational efforts.In 1881, on the 50th anniversary of the girls' school, he was officially thanked by King George I of Greece. On his death at Athens, the Greek government, in recognition of his educational work among the women of Athens, buried him with the honors of a taxiarch, and the Athenian municipality erected a monument to his memory. Honorary degrees were conferred on him by Harvard and Columbia.Frances Hill also died in Athens.  The school that the Hills founded is still in operation in Athens under the name of the Hill Memorial School.

William James Hubard	Question: question: Where is Julien Hall located?	Ref: corner Congress	Pred: Cambridgeshire	Context: William James Hubard (1807 – February 1862) was British-born artist who worked in England and the United States in the 19th century. He specialized in silhouette and painted portraits. Hubard arrived in the United States from England in 1824.In 1825–1826 he worked in Boston, Massachusetts, setting up an exhibition known as the "Hubard Gallery" at Julien Hall (corner Congress and Milk Streets). At the time Hubard would have been about 18 or 19 years old. A local newspaper reported "there is a great variety of pictures—likenesses, groups of animals, landscape scenery, caricatures, &c.—all cut with a simple pair of scissors, without the aid of any machinery whatever, and which a spectator might, at a hasty glance, take for painting." He received raves in the press: "He exercises his scissors with so much dexterity and skill, that an accurate profile, even of the most 'unmeaning face,' can be procured in twenty-five seconds, without the use of steam." Local resident John George Metcalf visited the gallery in 1825, and wrote in his diary:Hubard Gallery. This is a collection of cuttings of black paper of all the shapes and figures that can possibly be imagined. The figures after being cut out, are arranged and pasted on white paper which are skilfully and tastefully placed about the Hall. This Astonishing genius is a native of Shropshire in England and is now about fifteen years of age. Here, and all done with only a pair of common scissors, you can see the stately structures of Westminster Abbey, the Catholic Church at Glasgow and others all with their due proportion of light and shade. Here Napoleon has burst from the cearments of the grave and is upon his warhorse, as when on the bloody fields of Austerlitz and Marengo. Franklin too has come back, and stands for the patriot and Philosopher as when at the court of London he said "his Master shall pay for it." Kings and princes have left their gilded mausoleums, and at the will of Master Hubard are set up to be gazed at by clown and cobler. Besides these graver scenes we have the lighter ones of Life. Here Doctor Syntax and his whole Tour can be found and all his scenes of fun and merriment stand forth to be looked and laughed at. Fiddlers, Beggars, Bellmen, Irishmen and others ad infinitum, all as natural as life, all the creation of a pair of common scissors, attract the attention and excite the admiration of many a gazer. Horses and Dogs, pigs and pussies, and all that "sort o' thing," can here be found from the size of a thumb-nail to that of a platter. In fine here any one, if he is not made by one of Nature's journeymen, can find fun and frolic enough to last a week.Hubard later moved to Richmond, Virginia where he married Maria Mason Tabb, the daughter of wealthy clients in nearby Gloucester County. He also became friends with Mann S. Valentine, II who supported and promoted his work.On January 14, 1853, he was given exclusive license by the Virginia General Assembly to make bronze copies of the marble statue of George Washington by French sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon, producing them as of 1856, with a total of six in all.In February 1862, he was killed in an accidental explosion while making munitions in Richmond for the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War.Works by Hubard reside in the collections of Historic New England, the Smithsonian, and The Valentine in Richmond.

He also studied the Old Masters, and artists of the Barbizon school during later trips to Europe. There he was introduced to the theology of Emanuel Swedenborg, which was significant for him; he expressed that spiritualism in the works of his maturity (1879–1894).Although Inness's style evolved through distinct stages over a prolific career that spanned more than forty years and 1,000 paintings, his works consistently earned acclaim for their powerful, coordinated efforts to elicit depth of mood, atmosphere, and emotion. Neither pure realist nor impressionist, Inness was a transitional figure, He worked to combine both the earthly and the ethereal in order to capture the complete essence of a locale in his works. A master of light, color, and shadow, he became noted for creating highly ordered and complex scenes that often juxtaposed hazy or blurred elements with sharp and refined details to evoke an interweaving of both the physical and the spiritual nature of experience. In Inness's words, he attempted through his art to demonstrate the "reality of the unseen” and to connect the "visible upon the invisible."Within his lifetime, art critics hailed Inness as one of America's greatest artists. Often called "the father of American landscape painting," Inness is best known for his mature works that not only exemplified the Tonalist movement but also displayed an original and uniquely American style.

Keller's students at the Cleveland School of Art and his Berlin Heights, Ohio summer school included Charles E. Burchfield, Paul Travis, and Frank N. Wilcox.In the Leslie Family Record, by Elvesta Thomas Leslie (1968, self-published), a first cousin of Henry, spoke of Henry Keller:"As Mortimer (Leslie) died young, widowhood threw Guineveer’s mother (Elizabeth Bonsor) to the support of herself and her small girl. She met the heavy and double misfortune with fortitude and competency even as you and your (Elvesta’s) aunt Rosa (Kehl) met like but more tragic adversities. She took orders for busts in crayon and hired artists to draw them. In this way she met young Keller, and Guineveer, her romance. Henry made portraits for the mother. Henry Keller was educated here (Cleveland) and in Munich. He was one of a small galaxy of local artists who have won honors in more metropolitan centers. He is a pioneer of the city’s higher cultural life. A harder, or mor conscientious worker can not be found. He maintains his better than average constitution, inherited from German-born parents, by regular life and exemplary habits. He is the only noted artist who doesn’t smoke, that I ever heard of. Cigarettes seem the sustenance of the artistic temperament. Henry teaches painting at the Art School and specializes in animal life and watercolor. I have one of his best. His canvasses are distinguished more for the excellence of their technique and craftsmanship than for creative genius. I found Keller a zealous devotee of his profession and outside of it, enough of a cynic to be realistic. In a word he is master of a fine art, man of fine character and characteristically German. His home was originally a farm house owned by his father before Cleveland grew up to be a city."In 1939 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Academician.

His approximate birth year has been established through census records, but no birth certificate or baptismal record has been found. Naturalization papers in Annapolis, Maryland, dating from 1788, list a Frederick Kimmelmeiger, who is assumed to be him, although it is not known when or why he came to the United States. Speculation has centered around a Friedrich Kimmelmeyer who served as a medic with the Hessians during the Revolution, deserted to the Americans, and was briefly married in South Carolina, but no firm connection has been made.Soon after becoming a citizen, he placed advertisements in the Maryland Gazette and the Baltimore Advertiser, offering his services as a drawing instructor, a painter of miniatures and a sign painter. Many of his early works are copies of European lithographs and engravings.He remained in Baltimore until 1803, when he became an itinerant portrait painter. Over the next fourteen years, his travels can be traced through his advertisements, beginning in Alexandria, Virginia, where he opened a school. Shortly after, he relocated to Georgetown. Several of his paintings from that period are portraits of George Washington or scenes from battles that feature him. By 1805, he appears to have been in Hagerstown, then went a bit further, to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. This was followed, in 1810, by advertisements in Winchester, Virginia. Two years later, he taught and painted in what is now West Virginia. His last known advertisement appeared in 1816, in Hagerstown. A combination of age and alcoholism apparently had a serious negative effect on his ability to paint.His last years are largely undocumented. Only eleven portraits have been positively identified as his.

John Frederick Kensett	Question: question: Who did John Frederick Kensett owe much of his early work to?	Ref: Thomas Cole	Pred: Thomas Cole	Context: John Frederick Kensett (March 22, 1816 – December 14, 1872) was an Americanlandscape painter and engraver born in Cheshire, Connecticut. He was a member of the second generation of the Hudson River School of artists. Kensett's signature works are landscape paintings of New England and New York State, whose clear light and serene surfaces celebrate transcendental qualities of nature, and are associated with Luminism. Kensett's early work owed much to the influence of Thomas Cole, but was from the outset distinguished by a preference for cooler colors and an interest in less dramatic topography, favoring restraint in both palette and composition. The work of Kensett's maturity features tranquil scenery depicted with a spare geometry, culminating in series of paintings in which coastal promontories are balanced against glass-smooth water. He was a founder of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Marchant was active in New York City after 1832, completing many portraits of well-to-do merchants and political leaders during the 1830s and 1840s; in addition, he completed commissions in several Ohio cities as well as in Nashville and New Orleans, before settling in Philadelphia in 1854 where he would remain for another thirty years. Although mostly known for his portraits in oil, Marchant also created miniatures. He was elected to a number of arts academies and exhibited regularly during his lifetime.An ardent opponent of slavery who advocated for the return of slaves to Africa, Marchant was commissioned by the Union League of Philadelphia in December 1862 to paint a portrait of Abraham Lincoln to be displayed in Independence Hall. Marchant worked in the White House for several months in early 1863, having daily contact with the President, and ultimately depicted him seated at a table having just signed the Emancipation Proclamation. Marchant said that his painting "triumphantly gives lie to those hideous caricatures of Mr. Lincoln" which were at the time widely circulated in the hostile press. Authorized reproductions of Marchant's somewhat idealized portrait were widely circulated prior to the 1864 presidential election, and printed at a rate of 1,000 per day.Another 1864 Marchant portrait of Lincoln is featured today in the Lincoln Room of the President's Guest House (known as Blair House) in Washington, D.C., where it may be viewed by visiting dignitaries. Marchant died in Asbury Park, New Jersey on August 15, 1887.

Homer Dodge Martin	Question: question: Where did Homer Dodge Martin return to in 1887?	Ref: New York City	Pred: New York City	Context: Homer Dodge Martin (October 28, 1836 – February 12, 1897) was an American artist, particularly known for his landscape paintings. Examples of Martin's work are in many important American museums. Martin was born in Albany, New York on October 28, 1836, the fourth and youngest son of Homer Martin and Sarah Dodge.  A pupil for a short time of William Hart, his earlier work was closely aligned with the Hudson River School. Other Albany painters of his acquaintance included George Boughton, and Edward Gay.During the 1860s he spent the summers in the Adirondacks, Catskills and White Mountains, and painted landscapes from the sketches he made there at his studio in New York City's Tenth Street Studio Building.On June 25, 1861 he married Elizabeth Gilbert Davis, also of Albany.Martin was elected as associate of the National Academy of Design, New York, in 1868, and a full academician in 1874. During a trip to Europe in 1876, he was captivated by the Barbizon school and the Impressionists, and thereafter his painting style gradually became darker, moodier, and more loosely brushed.From 1882 to 1886, he lived in France, spending much of the time in Normandy, including stays at the Etaples art colony. His work there included a topographical view of the harbor in which a wooden-hulled ship is being built in the distance and a steam ship is seen moored on the quays. The rather more atmospheric Cottage in the Forest captures the effect of the parting sun on the dune landscape. At Villerville on the Seine, he painted his celebrated Harp of the Winds, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.By 1887 Martin had returned to New York City.  In 1893, poverty and poor health induced him to relocate to St. Paul, Minnesota, where he had relatives. There, nearly blind, he painted one of his best-known works, Adirondack Scenery (1895) from memory. He died on February 12, 1897, in St. Paul. Although never successful within his lifetime, within two years of his death Adirondack Scenery sold for $5500 and Harp of the Winds (1895) was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Wallace Morgan	Question: question: Who did Collier's commission Morgan to tour the US?	Ref: Julian Bond	Pred: Julian Bond	Context: Wallace Morgan (1875 – April 24, 1948) was a war artist for the United States Army during World War I. Morgan was born in 1875, and he grew up in Albany, New York, where his family had moved shortly after his birth. Upon graduation from high school, he returned to his birthplace, New York City, to pursue a career in art. He studied at the National Academy of Design while working at the New York Sun as a part-time artist.In 1898, he joined the staff of the New York Herald and became a full-time newspaper artist covering whatever assignments came his way, including a 1902 trip to Martinique to cover the eruptions of Mt. Pele. During this period, he developed the ability to render a faithful picture of nature with little need for preliminary sketches, an essential skill for a newspaper illustrator who had to convey to readers the image of an event quickly and accurately.After eleven years with the Herald, he opened his own studio. Shortly thereafter, Collier's commissioned him and Julian Bond to tour the United States and report their findings in words and pictures. Two trips across the country each produced a book that presented a light view of life in America. World War I and Morgan's selection as an AEF artist brought an early end to a third trip. Morgan put his ability to sketch quickly to good use during the war. His work projects an air of activity and movement into scenes of combat. A number of his pictures also reflect his apparent interest in the many columns of troops, animals, and equipment that moved ceaselessly across the battlefields of France. After the war, Morgan returned to work in his studio in New York City.Morgan was president of the Society of Illustrators from 1929 to 1936. In 1945, he made a comic strip adaptation of Margery Sharp's novel Cluny Brown. He died at home of a heart attack on April 24, 1948. He was survived by his sister Elizabeth G.

Grosvenor, while still in his early teens, and also was taught the basics of painting by an amateur landscape painter, George Kerr.
Reuben Moulthrop	Question: question: In what state was Moulthrop based?	Ref: Connecticut	Pred: Connecticut	Context: Reuben Moulthrop (1763–1814) was an early American artist based in East Haven, Connecticut. During his lifetime Moulthrop was famous for the wax figures that he arranged in tableaux (which at the time were so popular that they were even exported to the West Indies), but he is known to posterity through his portraits, which are in many important collections, including those of the American Folk Art Museum, the Detroit Institute of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the New York Historical Society.He was only twenty years old when the Revolutionary War ended: although his life spanned from colonial America to the new republic, his career coincided with the early decades of national independence. Though his earliest documented works, the portraits of Sarah and Job Perit in the Metropolitan Museum, date from 1790, earlier works, such as the portraits of Mary and James Reynolds in the American Folk Art Museum, have been attributed to the artist. Ezra Stiles, the president of Yale College from 1778 to 1795, praised Moulthrop as a "self taught painter" who "pleased with his genius", which suggests how esteemed Moulthrop's work was by the ruling class of the new republic, where there was as yet little art to see. Moulthrop's work thus contributed to the establishment of an early standard.Moulthrop's work is an early example of the adaptation of the European form of portraiture to American realities; it testifies to the development of European-style bourgeois culture on the American frontier. Moulthrop's work evinces the influence of the Colonial painter John Durand, who had been active in East Haven as well as in New York and Virginia. In turn he was a likely influence on the Connecticut-born portraitist Ammi Phillips, whose namesake the Reverend Ammi Ruhamah Robbins was painted by Moulthrop.A retrospective devoted to Moulthrop's work at the Connecticut Historical Society in 1956–1957 revealed unlikely inconsistencies in the oeuvre attributed to Moulthrop. It is therefore difficult to assign works to Moulthrop with certainty.

He was one of the main organizers of the 1913 Armory Show, which introduced European modernism to America.Born in Petersburg, Virginia and raised in Philadelphia, Trenton and Baltimore, he spent his adult life in New York City. Myers worked briefly as an actor and scene painter. He then studied art for a year at Cooper Union followed by study at the Art Students League over a period of eight years where his main teacher was George de Forest Brush. In 1896 he went to Paris, but only stayed a few months, believing that his main classroom was the streets of New York's Lower East Side. His strong interest and feelings for the new immigrants resulted in over a thousand drawings, as well as paintings, etchings and watercolors that depicted their lives outside of the tenements which were their first homes in America.In a 1923 magazine article he explained why cities were his greatest source of inspiration:All my life I had lived, worked and played in the poorest streets of American cities. I knew them and their population and was one of them. Others saw ugliness and degradation there, I saw poetry and beauty, so I came back to them. I took a sporting chance of saying something out of my own experience and risking whether it was worthwhile or not.  That is all any artist can do.

Ref: Charleston	Pred: Charleston, South Carolina	Context: Raphaelle Peale (sometimes spelled Raphael Peale) (February 17, 1774 – March 4, 1825) is considered the first professional American painter of still-life. Peale was born in Annapolis, Maryland, the fifth child, though eldest surviving, of the painter Charles Willson Peale and his first wife Rachel Brewer. He grew up in Philadelphia, and spent his life there in a home at the corner of 3rd and Lombard. Like his siblings (almost all of whom were named after famous artists or scientists),  Raphaelle was trained by his father as an artist. Early in his career, the pair collaborated on portraits. On some commissions, Raphaelle painted miniatures while his brother, Rembrandt, painted full-size portraits.In 1793, he made a trip to South America in order to collect specimens for the Peale Museum founded by his father. He exhibited five portraits and eight other paintings, probably still lifes, at the Columbianum, Philadelphia in 1794. His first professional exhibition was in 1795 at the age of 21. In 1797, with his brother Rembrandt, he traveled to Charleston, South Carolina, where they attempted to establish another museum. The plan fell through, however, and Raphaelle returned to painting miniatures.He married Martha (Patty) McGlathery at the age of twenty, and with her had eight children. For about two years beginning in 1803, Peale toured Virginia with the "physiognotrace", a profile making machine, with which he was briefly successful. By 1806 he had begun to suffer the symptoms of arsenic and mercury poisoning brought on by his work as a taxidermist in his father's museum. In August 1809 he was hospitalized with delirium, and for the rest of his life he suffered debilitating attacks almost yearly—which his father ascribed to "gout of the stomach" caused by consumption of pickles and excessive drinking. From 1810, Peale concentrated on still-life painting almost exclusively, becoming America's first professional still-life painter, and he exhibited frequently at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and elsewhere, especially from 1814 to 1818. By 1813, he was unable to walk without crutches. After the downturn in his health, in an era when most artists considered still life a subject worthy only of amateurs, he devoted himself almost exclusively to still life painting. It is for these works he is best known. His work was on frequent exhibit at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts between 1814 and 1818. After reportedly indulging in a night of heavy drinking, his health destroyed, he died on March 4, 1825, at age 51 at his home in Philadelphia.

His artwork is identified as folk art, primitive art, provincial art, and itinerant art without consensus among scholars, pointing to the enigmatic nature of his work and life. He is attributed to over eight hundred paintings, although only eleven are signed. While his paintings are formulaic in nature, Phillips paintings were under constant construction, evolving as he added or discarded what he found successful, while taking care to add personal details that spoke to the identity of those who hired him. He is most famous for his portraits of children in red, although children only account for ten percent of his entire body of work. The most well known of this series, Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog, would be sold for one million dollars, a first for folk art. His paintings hung mostly unidentified, spare for some recognition in the collections like those of Edward Duff Balken, for decades until his oeuvre was reconstructed by Barbara Holdridge and Larry Holdridge, collectors and students of American folk art, with the support of the art historian Mary Black. Ammi Phillip's body of work was expanded upon their discovery that the mysterious paintings of a "Kent Limner" and "Border Limner" were indeed his.

Before Piccirilli and his family arrived in America, many American artists were forced to travel to Italy to have their models carved into stone. In the case of Attilio, if an artist presented him with small plaster model, Attilio could create a marble replica to any size. In fact, the vast majority of Attilio's works were designed by other artists. Fragilina is one of the view works that was designed and sculpted into marble by Attilio himself. Piccirilli's most famous work is the creation of the Lincoln statue for the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, which was originally designed by Daniel Chester French. Attilio and his family collaborated with Paul Bartlett, Frederick MacMonnies, Hermon MacNeil, Massey Rhind, Karl Bitter, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Olin Warner, Lorado Taft, Charles Niehaus, and Andrew O'Connor. Piccirrili also did architectural work for Cass Gilbert, Henry Bacon, McKim, Mead, and White, Carrére, and Hastings. Attilio's most famous works that which he designed and sculpted are the Maine Monument in Central Park, New York and the Fireman's Monument on Riverside Drive, New York. He also designed a Monument to Guglielmo Marconi (1941) in Washington DC.Piccirilli became a member of the National Academy of Design and the Architectural League. He won numerous prizes including a Gold Medal at the Panama Pacific Exposition in San Francisco in 1915. Attilio also helped create the Leonardo da Vinci Art School in New York City, New York. Its purpose was to give affordable training in art, like sculpture, to New York's poor.Piccirilli's 1935 Pyrex glass relief sculpture Advance Forever, Eternal Youth over the entrance of the Palazzo d'Italia at Rockefeller Center was removed during World War Two when the Italian inscriptions were used by Mussolini, and it was associated with fascist iconography. It disappeared from storage some years afterwards.Piccirilli is represented in the sculpture collection at Brookgreen Gardens.  His work is also found in museums around the United States. White marble "Fragilina" now stands in the newly re-arranged American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.He died in New York City in 1945.  He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City. His half-length portrait by Edmond Thomas Quinn is in the collection of the National Academy of Design.

Ref: November	Pred: November 1868	Context: Alexander Phimister Proctor (September 27, 1860 – September 5, 1950) was an American sculptor with the contemporary reputation as one of the nation's foremost animaliers. Proctor was born on September 27, 1860 in Bosanquet, Ontario, near the village of Arkona, Ontario, the son of Thirzah Smith (born 1832), herself daughter of a contractor on the Erie and Welland Canals, and Alexander Proctor (1822–alive 1904). The family left Canada in 1866 and moved to Iowa and then to Denver, Colorado, when Alexander was eleven. Growing up on the frontier, Proctor early developed into a skilled woodsman and hunter—interests that remained with him for the rest of his life. In his autobiography, Sculptor in Buckskin, he spends as much ink, and seems to be as excited about killing his first bear and elk as he is about obtaining his first major commission.Along with his gun, Proctor took pencils and a sketching pad with him on his trips through the Rocky Mountains. As a hunter he always was careful to measure, draw, and sometimes dissect the animals that had crossed his gun sights. These early studies helped propel him to the position of one of the most sought after and respected animaliers of his day. He was fortunate to find an art instructor in the still rough and tumble Colorado, where his early drawings included big horn sheep, elk, bears, and the lynching of outlaw L. H. Musgrove, which occurred in Denver in November 1868.

At 18 he went to New York City to study at the Cooper Union Art School, then the Düsseldorf Academy, then continued on to Munich, studying under the Kentucky-born artist Frank Duveneck in his Venice and Florence schools, becoming one of the "Duveneck Boys". After some years in Paris and London, Rolshoven decided to settle in Florence in 1902. In 1905, while he was drawing outdoors, he discovered a building that had maintained the old charm of a castle, called "Devil's Castle" and belonged to the family Talani.

As a humanist, he worked to protect freedom of speech, end the persecution of minority communities, aid refugees, and mitigate conflict among nations. In this work, he is remembered for leading a group of civic, religious, labor, racial, and business leaders whose single goal was the passage and subsequent ratification of the United Nations Genocide Convention.
Louis Rémy Mignot	Question: question: What nationality was Mignot?	Ref: American	Pred: American	Context: Louis Rémy Mignot (February 3, 1831 – September 22, 1870) was an American painter of Huguenot descent. Associated with the Hudson River School of landscape artists, his southern US heritage and the influence of his time spent in Europe gave him a distinct style within that group, in painting vegetation and atmospheric effects.Mignot's parents came to the US from France after the Bourbon Restoration in 1815. Mignot pursued his interest in art in Europe beginning in 1848, and spent much of his life outside the US. Starting in 1850 he worked for four years in Andreas Schelfhout's studio in The Hague, Netherlands, then travelled in Europe. Returning to New York City, he soon travelled with artist Frederic Edwin Church to Ecuador in 1857, gathering material for his paintings of the tropics, the subject of a large portion of his subsequent work. In 1858 he had a studio at the Tenth Street Studio Building in New York City. The next year the National Academy of Design, where he had first exhibited in 1853, elected him as an associate, and in 1860 he became an academician. He collaborated with painters Eastman Johnson and John W. Ehninger, who provided figures for his landscapes, and Thomas Rossiter, whose history paintings of Mount Vernon benefitted from Mignot's landscapes.With the outbreak of the American Civil War, he raised money with a sale of his paintings, then sailed to England in June 1862, where he lived in London. His exhibitions at the Royal Academy between 1863 and 1871 were warmly received. His work was shown at the 1870 Paris Salon. He died in England of smallpox in 1870, shortly after fleeing France due to the Franco-Prussian War.In 1996, the North Carolina Museum of Art held an exhibition of Mignot's work,  the result of five years of research by  John W. Coffey, a curator at the museum, which led to the discovery of dozens of Mignot's paintings. He co-authored an exhibition catalogue with Katherine E. Manthorne, and the exhibition, "Louis Remy Mignot: A Southern Painter Abroad", toured to the National Academy of Design in 1997. This led to a reassessment of Mignot's work, with one academic specializing in American painting of the era rating him as highly as Church in the pantheon of nineteenth-century American artists.

Ref: Confederate memorial	Pred: Confederate memorial	Context: Frederick Wellington Ruckstull, German: Friedrich Ruckstuhl (May 22, 1853 – May 26, 1942) was a French-born American sculptor and art critic. Born Ruckstuhl in Breitenbach, Alsace, France, his family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, in 1855. He worked at a variety of unsatisfying jobs until his early twenties when an art exhibition in St. Louis inspired him to become a sculptor. He studied art locally, visited Paris and then worked for years as a toy store clerk to save enough to study in Paris for three years. In 1885, Ruckstull entered the Académie Julian, and studied under Gustave Boulanger, Camille Lefèvre, Jean Dampt and Antonin Mercié. He considered studying with Auguste Rodin, but claimed to be disgusted with his style.On returning to U.S. in 1892, Ruckstull opened a studio in New York City. His work Evening won the grand medal for sculpture at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. As a result of this national exposure, he was commissioned to make an equestrian statue of Major-General John F. Hartranft for the Pennsylvania State University. In 1893, Ruckstull was appointed to teach modeling and marble carving at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Schools in New York City.He was also deeply involved with creating Confederate memorial sculpture, forging a sculptural iconography for the Southern ideology of the Lost Cause.Ruckstull was a founding member of the National Sculpture Society as well as the editor of the conservative magazine Art World, where he wrote under the pseudonym Petronius Arbiter, a reference to the Satyricon. In the spring of 1917, he wrote a manifesto inveighing against degenerate modernist art, where he attacked both the artworks and the artists, using racist tropes and the quasi-medical language of physiognomy to attack them.In 1925 he wrote the book Great Works of Art and What Makes Them Great, a collection of essays he had published previously, which has recently been reprinted. His sculpture was in the figurative Beaux-Arts style, with its realism, and detailed modeling. He and other prominent sculptors of the era such as Daniel Chester French championed the French style of studio system teaching, art societies, and exhibitions. Following the Armory Show of 1913, he continued to represent the old guard of academic sculpture, a perspective clearly expressed in his book.Ruckstull married in 1896 and had one son.  He died at his home in New York on May 26, 1942, four days after his 89th birthday, and was cremated.

Ryder stayed in France for several years, living in an art colony at Étaples and exhibiting his work at the Paris Salon (1903–1909). He took on occasional students, including American painter William Posey Silva. His developing style was influenced by the dramatic compositions of his friend, painter Max Bohm, and by his admiration for the Japanese artist Hokusai.

Philip Martiny	Question: question: Who did Martiny work with in New Hampshire?	Ref: Saint-Gaudens	Pred: Augustus Saint-Gaudens	Context: Philip H. Martiny (May 19, 1858 – June 26, 1927) was a French-American sculptor who worked in the Paris atelier of Eugene Dock, where he became foreman before emigrating to New York in 1878—to avoid conscription in the French army, he later claimed. In the United States he found work with Augustus Saint-Gaudens, with whom he remained five years; a fellow worker in Saint-Gaudens' shop was Frederick MacMonnies. A group photograph taken in Saint-Gaudens's studio about 1883, conserved in the Archives of American Art, shows Kenyon Cox, Richard Watson Gilder, Martiny, Francis Davis Millet,  Saint-Gaudens, Julian Alden Weir and Stanford White.He often worked in cooperation with architects in Beaux-Arts architecture. He lived in Bayside, Long Island, and had a sculpture studio in McDougal Alley, a fashionable former mews behind Washington Square Park. Much of his work is in New York City, though he provided bas-reliefs for the Art Institute of Chicago and for government buildings in Washington, DC. Martiny was one of the colony who gathered round Saint-Gaudens at Cornish, New Hampshire.Martiny was one of the large team of decorative sculptors assembled to carry out details for the World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893, where he settled for a year to carry out the clay models for many somewhat facile decorative allegorical figures, cherubs, caryatids and the like. Karl Bitter diplomatically characterised Martiny's technique:He works with incredible rapidity and apparently with little reflection, but always with such an instinct for the right thing, decoratively speaking, that he rarely fails in his resultsThe sculptures, which were carried out in staff, a weather-resistant plaster, were destroyed with the exhibition buildings, but the successful effect they produced led to further similar commissions at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York (1901) and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St Louis (1904). His growing reputation led to his only medal, an award medal for the 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia.Though he was a member of the National Sculpture Society, Philip Martiny was not considered by his contemporaries as a sculptor of the first rank, and the assignation to him by the Tammany Hall architects given the plum project of completing designs for the New York City Hall of Records (later the Surrogate's Court) after the architect John R. Thomas's unexpected death in 1901, raised objections that tested the New York Art Commission's authority to accept or reject sculpture by Henry Kirke Bush-Brown and Martiny for the building. Daniel Chester French was called in to offer suggestions for improved subjects which Martiny finished in 1907.In the midst of the project Martiny was interviewed for The New York Times giving the first impression that Martiny operated a commercial sculpture factory "where Art rubs elbows cheerfully, indiscriminately, with Life's less romantic work" but ending with admiration for the sculptor's likeness of the late President McKinley.After the First World War, Martiny received two commissions for colossal figures commemorating the fallen soldiers: the Chelsea Park Memorial, at 28th Street and 9th Avenue and the memorial in Abingdon Square Park, where 8th Avenue commences.Martiny married twice and had eight children. A debilitating stroke ended his career, and a second one finished his life. His papers, compiled by Martiny's grandson, Raymond J. Linder, are conserved in the Archives of American Art, The Smithsonian Institution.

Jacopo Tintoretto	Question: question: What was the name of the Venetian painter?

His contemporaries both admired and criticized the speed with which he painted, and the unprecedented boldness of his brushwork. For his phenomenal energy in painting he was termed Il Furioso ("The Furious"). His work is characterised by his muscular figures, dramatic gestures and bold use of perspective, in the Mannerist style.
Rembrandt	Question: question: What was the nationality of Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn?	Ref: Dutch	Pred: Dutch	Context: Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (, Dutch: [ˈrɛmbrɑnt ˈɦɑrmə(n)ˌsoːɱ vɑn ˈrɛin] (listen); 15 July 1606 – 4 October 1669), usually simply known as Rembrandt, was a Dutch Golden Age painter, printmaker and draughtsman. An innovative and prolific master in three media, he is generally considered one of the greatest visual artists in the history of art and the most important in Dutch art history.Unlike most Dutch masters of the 17th century, Rembrandt's works depict a wide range of style and subject matter, from portraits and self-portraits to landscapes, genre scenes, allegorical and historical scenes, biblical and mythological themes and animal studies. His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch Golden Age, when Dutch art (especially Dutch painting), whilst antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, was prolific and innovative. This era gave rise to important new genres. Like many artists of the Dutch Golden Age, such as Jan Vermeer, Rembrandt was an avid art collector and dealer.Rembrandt never went abroad, but was considerably influenced by the work of the Italian masters and Netherlandish artists who had studied in Italy, like Pieter Lastman, the Utrecht Caravaggists, Flemish Baroque, and Peter Paul Rubens. After he achieved youthful success as a portrait painter, Rembrandt's later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial hardships. Yet his etchings and paintings were popular throughout his lifetime, his reputation as an artist remained high, and for twenty years he taught many important Dutch painters.Rembrandt's portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits and illustrations of scenes from the Bible are regarded as his greatest creative triumphs. His self-portraits form an intimate autobiography. Rembrandt's foremost contribution in the history of printmaking was his transformation of the etching process from a relatively new reproductive technique into an art form. His reputation as the greatest etcher in the history of the medium was established in his lifetime. Few of his paintings left the Dutch Republic while he lived, but his prints were circulated throughout Europe, and his wider reputation was initially based on them alone.In his works, he exhibited knowledge of classical iconography. A depiction of a biblical scene was informed by Rembrandt's knowledge of the specific text, his assimilation of classical composition, and his observations of Amsterdam's Jewish population. Because of his empathy for the human condition, he has been called "one of the great prophets of civilization". The French sculptor Auguste Rodin said, "Compare me with Rembrandt! What sacrilege! With Rembrandt, the colossus of Art! We should prostrate ourselves before Rembrandt and never compare anyone with him!"
Michelangelo	Question: question: What scene was on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel?	Ref: Genesis	Pred: Genesis	Context: Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (Italian: [mikeˈlandʒelo di lodoˈviːko ˌbwɔnarˈrɔːti siˈmoːni]; 6 March 1475 – 18 February 1564), known as Michelangelo (English: ), was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance. Born in the Republic of Florence, his work was inspired by models from classical antiquity and had a lasting influence on Western art. Michelangelo's creative abilities and mastery in a range of artistic arenas define him as an archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and elder contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci. Given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences, Michelangelo is one of the best-documented artists of the 16th century. He was lauded by contemporary biographers as the most accomplished artist of his era.Michelangelo achieved fame early; two of his best-known works, the Pietà and David, were sculpted before the age of thirty. Although he did not consider himself a painter, Michelangelo created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. His design of the Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist architecture. At the age of 71, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica. Michelangelo transformed the plan so that the western end was finished to his design, as was the dome, with some modification, after his death.Michelangelo was the first Western artist whose biography was published while he was alive. In fact, two biographies were published during his lifetime. One of them, by Giorgio Vasari, proposed that Michelangelo's work transcended that of any artist living or dead, and was "supreme in not one art alone but in all three."In his lifetime, Michelangelo was often called Il Divino ('the divine one'). His contemporaries often admired his terribilità—his ability to instill a sense of awe in viewers of his art. Attempts by subsequent artists to imitate the expressive physicality of Michelangelo's style contributed to the rise of Mannerism, a short-lived movement in Western art following the High Renaissance.
Nicolas Poussin	Question: question: Which Renaissance and Baroque painters did Poussin study?	Ref: Raphael	Pred: Raphael	Context: Nicolas Poussin (UK: , US: , French: [nikɔla pusɛ̃]; June 1594 – 19 November 1665) was the leading painter of the classical French Baroque style, although he spent most of his working life in Rome. Most of his works were on religious and mythological subjects painted for a small group of Italian and French collectors. He returned to Paris for a brief period to serve as First Painter to the King under Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, but soon returned to Rome and resumed his more traditional themes. In his later years he gave growing prominence to the landscape in his paintings. His work is characterized by clarity, logic, and order, and favors line over color. Until the 20th century he remained a major inspiration for such classically-oriented artists as Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Paul Cézanne.Details of Poussin's artistic training are somewhat obscure. Around 1612 he traveled to Paris, where he studied under minor masters and completed his earliest surviving works. His enthusiasm for the Italian works he saw in the royal collections in Paris motivated him to travel to Rome in 1624, where he studied the works of Renaissance and Baroque painters—especially Raphael, who had a powerful influence on his style. He befriended a number of artists who shared his classicizing tendencies, and met important patrons, such as Cardinal Francesco Barberini and the antiquarian Cassiano dal Pozzo. The commissions Poussin received for modestly scaled paintings of religious, mythological, and historical subjects allowed him to develop his individual style in works such as The Death of Germanicus, The Massacre of the Innocents, and the first of his two series of the Seven Sacraments.He was persuaded to return to France in 1640 to be First Painter to the King but, dissatisfied with the overwhelming workload and the court intrigues, returned permanently to Rome after a little more than a year. Among the important works from his later years are Orion Blinded Searching for the Sun, Landscape with Hercules and Cacus, and The Seasons.

He painted primarily religious works, but also mythological and allegorical subjects. Active in Rome, Naples, and his native Bologna, he became the dominant figure in the Bolognese School that emerged under the influence of the Carracci.
Hans Memling	Question: question: Who did Memling marry?	Ref: Anna de Valkenaere	Pred: Anna de Valkenaere	Context: Hans Memling (also spelled Memlinc; c. 1430 – 11 August 1494) was a painter active in Flanders, who worked in the tradition of Early Netherlandish painting. He was born in the Middle Rhine region and probably spent his childhood in Mainz. He moved to the Netherlands and spent time in the Brussels workshop of Rogier van der Weyden. He was subsequently made a citizen of Bruges in 1465, where he became one of the leading artists, running a large workshop, which painted religious works that often incorporated donor portraits of his wealthy patrons. Memling's patrons included burghers (bankers, merchants, and politicians), clergymen, and aristocrats.Memling's portraits built upon the styles that he learned in his youth. He became very successful, and in 1480 was listed among the wealthiest citizens in a city tax list.He married Anna de Valkenaere sometime between 1470 and 1480, and they had three children. Memling's art was rediscovered in the 19th century,  attaining wide popularity.

Charles Courtney Curran	Question: question: Who awarded Curran the Third Hallgarten Prize for Oils?	Ref: NAD	Pred: NAD	Context: Charles Courtney Curran (13 February 1861 – 9 November 1942) was an American painter. He is best known for his canvases depicting women in various settings. Curran was born in Hartford, Kentucky in February, 1861, where his father taught at the school. A few months later after the beginning of the Civil War, the family left there and returned to Ohio, eventually settling in Sandusky on the shores of Lake Erie where the elder Curran served as superintendent of schools.Charles Curran showed an early interest and aptitude for art, and in 1881 went to Cincinnati to study at the McMicken School (later the Fine Arts Academy of Cincinnati).  He stayed there only a year before going to New York to study at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League. Many of the pictures he created during this period featured young attractive working-class women engaged in a variety of tasks.One was particularly noteworthy: Breezy Day (1887,  collection of Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts)  and won the Third Hallgarten Prize for Oils from the NAD in 1888.  Shortly thereafter Curran and his young bride Grace left the United States to study in Paris, where their first child Louis was born.After two and half years abroad, the young family returned to the United States in June, 1891. For the next ten years Curran divided his time between New York where the couple had an apartment and Curran maintained a studio, and Ohio where they had extended family and spent most summers. In 1903 the  Currans visited the summer arts colony of Cragsmoor for the first time.  Located in the scenic Shawangunk Mountains about 100 miles northwest of New York City, the spectacular scenery and native flora inspired Curran to build a summer home there. He died in New York City in 1942.
Anthony van Dyck	Question: question: Who was Van Dyck's contemporary?	Ref: Diego Velázquez	Pred: Diego Velzquez	Context: Sir Anthony van Dyck (Dutch pronunciation: [vɑn ˈdɛik], many variant spellings; 22 March 1599 – 9 December 1641) was a Flemish Baroque artist who became the leading court painter in England after success in the Spanish Netherlands and Italy.The seventh child of Frans van Dyck, a wealthy Antwerp silk merchant, Anthony painted from an early age. He was successful as an independent painter in his late teens, and became a master in the Antwerp guild in 1618. By this time he was working in the studio of the leading northern painter of the day, Peter Paul Rubens, who became a major influence on his work.  Van Dyck worked in London for some months in 1621, then returned to Flanders for a brief time, before travelling to Italy, where he stayed until 1627, mostly in Genoa. In the late 1620s he completed his greatly admired Iconography series of portrait etchings, mostly of other artists. He spent five years in Flanders after his return from Italy, and from 1630 was court painter for the archduchess Isabella, Habsburg Governor of Flanders. In 1632, he returned to London to be the main court painter, at the request of Charles I of England.With the exception of Holbein, van Dyck and his contemporary Diego Velázquez were the first painters of pre-eminent talent to work mainly as court portraitists, revolutionising the genre. He is best known for his portraits of the aristocracy, most notably Charles I, and his family and associates. Van Dyck became the dominant influence on English portrait-painting for the next 150 years. He also painted mythological and biblical subjects, including altarpieces, displayed outstanding facility as a draughtsman, and was an important innovator in watercolour and etching.  His influence extends into the modern period. The Van Dyke beard is named after him. During his lifetime, Charles I granted him a knighthood, and he was buried in St Paul's Cathedral, an indication of his standing at the time of his death.

The latter, which is probably the best of his works, received honorable mention at the Paris exposition in 1878.A critical appraisal appeared at about this time by the American writer, S.G.W. Benjamin:There is no uncertainty or weakness in his method of handling color; his lines are clearly and carefully drawn, and he undoubtedly achieves excellent results when he attempts simple compositions. One of Mr. Shirlaw's best known compositions, representing a sheep-shearing in Bavaria, has attracted favorable attention at home and abroad. In compositions which include animals, dogs, and birds, he has been especially happy. His inclinations to delineate the characteristics of bird-life are akin to those of the artists of Japan.Other notable works from his easel are Good Morning (1878), in the Buffalo Academy; Indian Girl and Very Old (1880); Gossip (1884); and Jealousy (1886), owned by the Academy of Design, New York. His largest work is the frieze for the dining-room in the house of Darius O. Mills in New York City. Shirlaw has also earned an excellent reputation as an illustrator. He was one of the founders of the Society of American Artists and its first president.On his return from Europe he took charge of the Art Students League of New York, and for several years taught in the composition class. He became an associate of the National Academy in 1887, and an academician the following year.He died in Madrid, Spain on December 26, 1909, and was buried in the British Cemetery there.

Grant Memorial on the west front of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. Shrady was born in New York City. His father, George Frederick Shrady, Sr., was one of the physicians who attended Ulysses S. Grant during the former president's struggle with throat cancer.In 1894, Shrady graduated from Columbia University, where he was a member of the Varsity Show, and then spent one year at Columbia's law school. He left law school to join with his brother-in-law, Jay Gould (son of the financier Edwin Gould), at the Continental Match Company. The company failed, and Shrady contracted typhoid fever, which diverted him forever from the business world. His recuperation left spare time to pursue a growing interest in art.Shrady's wife, Harrie Moore, submitted some of his paintings to an exhibition of the National Academy of Design without his knowledge, and they sold quickly. He then began to teach himself sculpture using zoo animals and his pets as models.He modeled a series of popular bronze statuettes, mostly of animals. His first major commission came in 1901, for George Washington at Valley Forge, an equestrian statue for Continental Army Plaza in Brooklyn, New York.

Ref: Queen-Street	Pred: Boston	Context: John Smibert (rarely spelled Smybert; ; 24 March 1688 – 2 April 1751) was a Scottish-born painter, regarded as the first academically trained artist to live and work regularly in British America. Born in Edinburgh on 24 March 1688, Smibert was the second youngest of six children of Alison and John Smibert, a litster, or wool dyer. From 1702–1709, he was apprenticed to a house painter and plasterer in Edinburgh. On moving to London in 1709 he worked as a coach painter and copyist.1713-1716, he studied under Godfrey Kneller at the Great Queen Street Academy, then returned to Edinburgh, seeking work as portraitist. Smibert travelled to Italy from 1719 to 1722 to copy old masters and then settled in London where he worked as a portrait painter from 1722-1728.Smibert became a member of the Rose and Crown Club and made a sketch for a group portrait of its members, including George Vertue, John Wootton, Thomas Gibson, Bernard Lens III, and others.Among his London portraits is one of Bishop Berkeley who, in 1728, enticed Smibert to accompanied him to America, with the intention of becoming professor of fine arts in the college which Berkeley was planning to found in Bermuda. The college, however, was never established, and Smibert settled in Boston, where he married in 1730. He lived at the corner of Brattle Street and Queen-Street. He belonged to the Scots Charitable Society of Boston.In 1728 he began painting "Dean George Berkeley and His Family," also called "The Bermuda group", now in the Yale University Art Gallery, Yale University, a group of eight figures; it is maintained that the person farthest to the left is actually the artist himself. He painted portraits of Jonathan Edwards and Judge Edmund Quincy (in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston), Mrs Smibert, Peter Faneuil and Governor John Endecott (in the Massachusetts Historical Society), John Lovell (Memorial Hall, Harvard University), and probably one of Sir William Pepperrell; and examples of his works are owned by Harvard and Yale Universities, by Bowdoin College, by the Massachusetts Historical Society, and by the New England Historical and Genealogical Society.In 1734, Smibert opened a shop where he sold paint, other artist's supplies, and prints. In his studio above the shop, he displayed casts and copies of Old Masters that he had painted in Europe. This collection, which Richard Saunders has termed "America's first art gallery", provided much of the early artistic education for Charles Willson Peale, Gilbert Stuart, and John Trumbull.Between 1740 and 1742, he served as architect for the original Faneuil Hall, which he designed in the style of an English country market. The hall burned down in 1761 but was restored, and then in 1806 greatly expanded and modified by Charles Bulfinch.His son Nathaniel was also a painter. Smibert lies in an unmarked grave in the Granary Burying Ground in Boston.

After graduation, he continued his law studies under his father, was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, and prepared two legal treatises of value — Treatise on the Law of Contracts not under Seal (2 vols., 1844) and Treatise on the Law of Sales of Personal Property (1847).He soon abandoned the law though to devote himself to sculpture, and after 1850 lived in Rome, where he had first visited in 1848, and where he counted among his friends the Brownings and Walter Savage Landor. In 1856, he received a commission for a bust of his late father, now in the Memorial Hall/Lowell Hall, Harvard University. Story's apartment in Palazzo Barberini became a central location for Americans in Rome. During the American Civil War his letters to the Daily News in December 1861 (afterwards published as a pamphlet, The American Question, i.e. of neutrality), and his articles in Blackwood's Magazine, had considerable influence on English opinion.One of his most famous works, Cleopatra, (1858) was described and admired in Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1860 romance, The Marble Faun, and is on display in New York, NY at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Gallery 700.  Another work, the Angel of Grief, has been replicated near the Stanford Mausoleum at Stanford University. Among the other life-size statues he completed were those of Saul, Sappho, Electra, Semiramide, Delilah, Judith, Medea, Jerusalem Desolate, Sardanapolis, Solomon, Orestes, Canidia, and Shakespeare. His Saul was completed in Rome in 1865, and taken to England by Noel Wills who displayed it at Rendcomb College. It is now in the collection of North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh. His Sibyl and Cleopatra were exhibited at the 1863 Universal Exposition in London.In the 1870s, Story submitted a design for the Washington Monument, then under a prolonged and troubled construction. Although the Washington National Monument Society considered his proposals "vastly superior in artistic taste and beauty" to the original 1836 design by Robert Mills, they were not adopted, and the monument was completed to Mills' scheme, only slightly modified. Story also sculpted a bronze statue of Joseph Henry on the Mall in Washington, D.C., the scientist who served as the Smithsonian Institution's first Secretary. His works Libyan Sibyl, Medea and Cleopatra are on display at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, GA.Story died at Vallombrosa Abbey, Italy, a place he was sentimentally attached to and which he chronicled in an informal travel journal, Vallombrosa in 1881.  He is buried with his wife, Emelyn Story, in the Protestant Cemetery, Rome, under a statue of his own design, Angel of Grief.A 1903 posthumous biography of Wetmore (and his circle), entitled William Wetmore Story and His Friends, was penned by Henry James.

Abbott Handerson Thayer	Question: question: Who mocked the book?	Ref: Theodore Roosevelt	Pred: Theodore Roosevelt and others	Context: Abbott Handerson Thayer (August 12, 1849 – May 29, 1921) was an American artist, naturalist and teacher. As a painter of portraits, figures, animals and landscapes, he enjoyed a certain prominence during his lifetime, and his paintings are represented in the major American art collections. He is perhaps best known for his 'angel' paintings, some of which use his children as models.During the last third of his life, he worked together with his son, Gerald Handerson Thayer, on a book about protective coloration in nature, titled Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom. First published by Macmillan in 1909, then reissued in 1918, it may have had an effect on military camouflage during World War I. However it was roundly mocked by Theodore Roosevelt and others for its assumption that all animal coloration is cryptic.Thayer also influenced American art through his efforts as a teacher, training apprentices in his New Hampshire studio.

Alfred Wordsworth Thompson	Question: question: Where was Alfred Wordsworth Thompson born?	Ref: Baltimore	Pred: Baltimore	Context: Alfred Wordsworth Thompson (May 26, 1840 – August 28, 1896) was an American landscape and history painter. Alfred Wordsworth Thompson was born in Baltimore on May 26, 1840. After completing his secondary education, he was enrolled at Newton University, to prepare him for a career in his father's law practice. His interest in art prevailed, however, and not long before the Civil War began, he had established his own art studio, where he created illustrations for Harper's Weekly and the Illustrated London News. His contributions to Harper's included a sketch of the abolitionist John Brown, whom he had visited in prison. When the war broke out, he went to work for them as a type of special correspondent; spending much of his time in Virginia.After holding that position for less than a year, and possibly fearing conscription, he quit and went to Paris, where he would remain until 1868. He was able to enter the École des Beaux-Arts in 1864; studying with Charles Gleyre, Alberto Pasini and Émile Lambinet. He also studied horse anatomy with the sculptor, Antoine-Louis Barye.  In 1865, he exhibited a landscape at the Salon. Later, before returning home, he visited Germany and Austria and took a walking tour from Heidelberg to Calabria.He chose to establish a studio in New York City, instead of Baltimore. Not long after, he exhibited some works at the National Academy of Design; becoming a member there in 1875. The Academy would be  his major venue, with over 125 paintings sold there; 40 of them depicting scenes from the Revolutionary War. Despite this, in 1878, he joined the Society of American Artists, an organization formed in opposition to the Academy's conservative approach.He married Mary Pumpelly in 1876.He was an avid traveller throughout his life, visiting Turkey, Morocco and Spain. In the 1870s, during the Reconstruction era, he made several what were then risky trips into Virginia and North Carolina, where he painted rural genre scenes. Some of those paintings were exhibited at the Brooklyn Art Association and at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia.His last twelve years were spent in semi-retirement in Summit, New Jersey. Many of his works may be seen at the New York Historical Society, the Union League Club, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and at the Chrysler Museum of Art. His Civil War painting Cannonading on the Potomac is in the art collection of the White House.Alfred Wordsworth Thompson died in Summit on August 28, 1896.
Cephas Thompson	Question: question: What was Cephas Thompson's occupation?	Ref: aught	Pred: Portrait painter	Context: Cephas Thompson (July 1, 1775 – November 6, 1856) was a successful, largely self-taught, early nineteenth-century itinerant portrait painter in the United States.  He was born, died, and lived most of his life in Middleborough, Massachusetts, but traveled extensively down the Atlantic coast and lived far from home for months at a time while pursuing his career as a portraitist.Thompson married Olive Leonard on March 18, 1802 (his full-length portrait of her survives in the Metropolitan Museum of Art). Their son, Cephas Giovanni Thompson, became a painter of portraits and landscape in his own right, and a friend of the author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Cephas and Olive's daughter Florantha married missionary Granville Sproat and, after spending time teaching at La Pointe, Wisconsin, moved to California during the gold rush. Florantha and Granville's daughter Elvira (Cephas Thompson's granddaughter) married James Hutchings, an early promoter of Yosemite National Park.Although Thompson lived most of his life in Middleborough, he produced portraits at several locations in southeastern New England.  From 1800 to 1825 he made many seasonal trips to the south to paint in Baltimore, Alexandria, Norfolk, Charleston, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Georgia.  Between 1805 and 1821 Thompson also paid five extended visits to Bristol, Rhode Island, where he painted over 132 portraits of merchants, ship-owners, sea captains, and their wives and children.  Approximately 65% of Thompson's Bristol sitters derived wealth from their head-of-households' participation in the African-Caribbean-Carolina slave-trade.  In April 1817 Thompson advertised his presence in Providence, Rhode Island, where he intended to paint portraits "in the Hall of Blake's Hotel".  Thompson may well have painted portraits in Providence during this visit; but none has yet been identified.  At about age 50, Thompson retired from itinerant painting to reside year-round on his Middleborough farm.Among Cephas Thompson's portrait subjects are John Marshall, Stephen Decatur, David Ramsay of South Carolina, John Howard Payne, Elizabeth Wirt, James DeWolf, and George Washington Parke Custis, who was his pupil.  As Deborah Sisum has noted and Keith Arbour has extensively documented, the most important patrons of Thompson's early career were members of the DeWolf family of Bristol, Rhode Island.  The largest collection of Thompson's work is in the Boston Athenæum, which also holds some of the artist's papers.  Portraits by Thompson are also in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum, Linden Place Museum, the Bristol Historical and Preservation Society Museum, and the Newport Historical Society.  The amateur historian George Decas, devoted chapters 16 and 17 of his biography of Col. Peter Peirce to Cephas Thompson.Local historian James Blachowicz has shown that from about 1788 to 1805 Cephas Thompson engraved over 50 slate gravestones near his Middleborough home.  One of these stones, for Robert Strobredge (d. 1790) in the Thompson Hill cemetery in Lakeville is signed “Cephas Tomson, sculpt.”  Blachowicz suggests that Thompson may have taken up this distinct art because of a kinship connection with Middleborough attorney and state senator Isaac Thompson (1746–1819), whose own relations included at least 8 gravestone carvers.  Isaac Thompson was Cephas's uncle-by-marriage, that is, Cephas's mother Deborah's sister Lucy Sturtevant's husband.  For additional details see James Blachowicz, From Slate to Marble: Gravestone Carving Traditions in Eastern Massachusetts, 1770–1870 (Graver Press, 2006), pp. 91–93.

Charles Frederic Ulrich	Question: question: Where did Charles Frederic Ulrich organize American art exhibits?	Ref: Munich	Pred: Museum of Modern Art	Context: Charles Frederic Ulrich (18 October 1858 – 15 May 1908) was an American Realist painter who spent most of his career in Germany. He is best known for his genre scenes of working-class people. He was born in New York City. His father, Friedrich, was from Germany. Ulrich began his art studies at the National Academy of Design and the Cooper Union. In 1875, after completing his work there, he took his first trip to Germany; visiting Munich, where he enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts. His primary instructors were Ludwig von Löfftz and Wilhelm von Lindenschmit. He also became friends with John Henry Twachtman and joined the circle of American-born artists who associated with Frank Duveneck in Munich and the Bavarian town of Polling.Between 1879 and 1881, Ulrich was back in the United States, where he made a study of the methods used by artists during the Golden Age of Dutch painting; especially the interiors of Pieter de Hooch and Jan Vermeer and the portraits of Frans Hals and Anthony van Dyck. In 1883, he was named an Associate Member of his alma mater, the National Academy, and a full member of the Society of American Artists. He soon became one of the few artists of that period to deal with the depiction of social issues. A notable work from this time was In the Land of Promise (1884), showing an immigrant in the reception station at Castle Garden.This attracted the attention of Thomas B. Clarke, a lace and linen manufacturer who was also a collector of contemporary art. Ulrich painted Clarke's portrait and Clarke promoted his career, awarding him the first Thomas B. Clarke Prize for "Best American Figure Composition".In the summer of 1884, Ulrich returned to Europe; travelling with William Merritt Chase and Robert Frederick Blum. They visited Belgium and the Netherlands. Ulrich and Blum shared an apartment in Haarlem. They were together for much of the next three years. Blum concentrated on scenes from everyday life, while Ulrich continued to focus on social commentary; including paintings done from sketches made in an orphanage.Europe became his home.

From here he went to Curaçao before moving on to arrive in New York in 1718. In this year he married Gerretje Van de Berg, who bore him a daughter the following year, but both died shortly afterwards. Four years later, he married Geertruy Vas, daughter of Petrus Vas, a Dutch clergyman with a congregation in Kingston, New York. He made his living as a portrait painter, land speculator and in other trades, travelling frequently between Kingston and Albany and residing at various times in each city.His paintings were completed between 1730 and 1745 and were all unsigned, though some bore an inscription. Analysis of these inscriptions, together with other sources, enabled Mary Black in 1969 to identify Vanderlyn as the "Gansevoort Limner," an otherwise unidentified portrait painter of this era, though the attribution remains controversial. There are works by Vanderlyn in the collections of the National Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Newark Museum of Art, the New-York Historical Society, the Terra Foundation for American Art and the Chrysler Museum of Art.Vanderlyn was living in Kingston during the American Revolutionary War until British forces burned the city on October 13, 1777.

James McNeill Whistler	Question: question: Who was an American painter active during the American Gilded Age?	Ref: James Abbott McNeill Whistler	Pred: James Abbott McNeill Whistler	Context: James Abbott McNeill Whistler  (; July 10, 1834 – July 17, 1903) was an American painter active during the American Gilded Age and based primarily in the United Kingdom. He eschewed sentimentality and moral allusion in painting and was a leading proponent of the credo "art for art's sake". His signature for his paintings took the shape of a stylized butterfly possessing a long stinger for a tail. The symbol combined both aspects of his personality: his art is marked by a subtle delicacy, while his public persona was combative. He found a parallel between painting and music, and entitled many of his paintings "arrangements", "harmonies", and "nocturnes", emphasizing the primacy of tonal harmony. His most famous painting, Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1 (1871), commonly known as Whistler's Mother, is a revered and often parodied portrait of motherhood. Whistler influenced the art world and the broader culture of his time with his theories and his friendships with other leading artists and writers.

George Henry Yewell	Question: question: Where did Yewell move the capital from Iowa City to?	Ref: Des Moines	Pred: Des Moines	Context: George Henry Yewell (20 January 1830 – 26 September 1923) was an American painter and etcher. Yewell was born in Havre de Grace, Maryland. His father died when he was a boy, and he and his mother left Maryland for Cincinnati, as she had family there; in that city he received some instruction from Theodore S. Parvin, who later became a prominent educator in Iowa. In 1841 mother and son moved again, to Iowa City, Iowa, where other members of their extended family lived. In 1848 Yewell apprenticed himself to a tailor to learn a trade, but at the same time he began showing an interest in art; a formative experience early in life was his encounter with a suite of prints based upon the cycle The Voyage of Life by Thomas Cole. His breakthrough came with a political cartoon he drew about the controversy surrounding the move of the state capital from Iowa City to Des Moines. He later described the incident:At the height of the excitement, I drew a large caricature, representing the Capitol building on wheels, and oxen pulling one way, upon whose shoulders were placed heads of members who voted for removal. On the other end of the building were those members who voted against the bill, represented by oxen whose feeble chain had broken and tumbled them in a heap. Principal leaders of the movement were represented as drivers; bodies of different animals, suited to their different characters, being in place of their own. The likenesses were easily recognized and the caricature created a sensation. It went from town to town over the state and made me widely known. Among those who took notice of the young artist was Charles Mason, Chief Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court. He collected a group of associates and together they financed the young man's move to New York City for the formal study of art. Charles Anderson Dana provided him with a letter of introduction to  Thomas Hicks, whose pupil he became, and in whose studio he met William Makepeace Thackeray. He then enrolled in the school of the National Academy of Design, which he attended from 1851 until 1853.

Henry Roderick Newman	Question: question: Where did Newman live after the war?	Ref: Italy	Pred: Italy	Context: Henry Roderick Newman (March 4, 1843 Easton, New York - December 1, 1917, Florence, Italy) was an American landscape and still-life painter, influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite style. In 1853, his family moved to New York City. Around 1860 he began studying to become a doctor, like his father but, in his spare time, taught himself to paint.When his father died, in 1861, he gave up medicine and, at the age of eighteen, declared his intention to become a painter. His mother, naturally displeased, gave him one year to prove that he could support himself that way. In response, he spent six months painting landscapes in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, after which he sent three paintings to the National Academy of Design. From 1864, he was a member of the American, Pre-Raphaelite-inspired, Association for the Advancement of the Cause of Truth in Art.In 1868, he was attracted to Florida for health reasons and became one of the first well-known American painters to work there, near St. Augustine. In spring 1870 he went to France, where he briefly studied with Jean-Léon Gérôme, but was dissatisfied with his methods. Shortly after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, he moved to Italy, where he lived for the rest of his life.There, he focused on architectural scenes and floral studies. In 1877, English critic John Ruskin saw his work and suggested subjects for him to paint, some of which he commissioned. Newman was married in 1883 to Englishwoman Mary Watson Willis.Beginning in 1887 he began spending winters in Egypt, remaining there several months every year. He returned to Egypt nearly every winter for the rest of his life. Most of the works he created on those visits are watercolors of ancient structures, especially of the Temple of Philae, rather than the usual Orientalist scenes. In 1896-1897 he visited Japan, where he did a group of architectural and landscape views.

Jean-Baptiste Huet	Question: question: Where is the Dairymaid located?	Ref: Musée Cognacq-Jay	Pred: Paris	Context: Jean-Baptiste Marie Huet (Paris, 15 October 1745 – Paris, 27 January 1811) was a French painter, engraver and designer associated with pastoral and genre scenes of animals in the Rococo manner, influenced by François Boucher.Born into a family of artists— his uncle was Christophe Huet, his father Nicolas Huet—he apprenticed with the animal painter Charles Dagomer, a member of the painters' guild, the Académie de Saint-Luc, Paris, who was working in the 1760s. Huet’s interest in printmaking and his acquaintance with Gilles Demarteau, who later engraved many of his compositions, both date from this period. About 1764 Huet entered the studio of Jean-Baptiste Le Prince, where he further developed his printmaking skills, largely reproducing his own paintings, a method of publishing them with some profit.In 1768 he was approved (agréé) by the Académie Royale, and 29 July 1769 he was received (reçu) in the minor category (petite manière) of painter of animals and was well received in the public reviews when he began to exhibit at the Paris Salon that same year, with a Dog Attacking Geese, now at the Louvre. He continued to exhibit annually until 1789, though his attempts at the grand manner of history painting, considered the noblest genre, were not met with approval.The most important of his paintings were his morceau de réception, the Fox among the Chickens  (San Francisco,  California Palace of the Legion of Honor), The Dairymaid  (Paris, Musée Cognacq-Jay).Huet is equally known for his designs for the decorative arts.  He provided scenic vignettes to be printed by copperplate on cottons at the manufacture of toiles de Jouy directed by Oberkampf. Lengths of these may be seen at The Detroit Institute of Arts, the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and many other institutions. His ink-and-wash drawings and studies of animals and children are also admired.In the 1780s he provided tapestry cartoons for the manufacture at Beauvais. A suite of thirteen hangings of pastorals was in the Isaac de Camondo bequest to the Louvre. In 1790 he remained attached to the reorganized and combined tapestry manufacture of Gobelins and Beauvais.
Sally Miller	Question: question: Who was the mother of Sally Miller?	Ref: Miller	Pred: Louis Belmonti	Context: Sally Miller, born Salomé Müller (c. 1814 – ?), was an American women enslaved sometime in the late 1810s, whose freedom suit in Louisiana was based on her claimed status as a free German immigrant and indentured servant born to non-enslaved parents. The case attracted wide attention and publicity because of the issue of "white" slavery. In Sally Miller v. Louis Belmonti (1845 La), the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled in her favor, and Miller gained freedom.Despite the doctrine of partus sequitur ventrum incorporated into state law, by which children followed the legal status of their mother at the time of birth, Miller was not successful in her attempt to gain freedom from slavery for her three surviving children. In a case settled in her favor by the judge, she won a case in which her former master John Fitz Miller tried to clear his name by proving that she was part-black and had been born into slavery in Miller v. Miller (1849 La). His appeal to the State Supreme Court was dismissed. Her identity remains controversial.

Clarissa Peters Russell	Question: question: Where did Clarissa Peters Russell marry?	Ref: Rhode Island	Pred: Providence, Rhode Island	Context: Clarissa Peters Russell (February 1, 1809 – August 12, 1854) was an American miniaturist. Her name is often given as Mrs. Moses B. Russell.A native of Andover, Massachusetts, Russell was one of twelve children; her younger sister, Sara Peters Grozelier, also became a miniaturist. Their parents were Elizabeth Farrington Davis and John Peters; the Peters family had long been prominent in local affairs, and her father served as chairman of the town's board of selectmen. The details of Clarissa's early education are not known, but it has been suggested that she studied at the Franklin Academy, the first incorporated school in Massachusetts to admit women and the institution attended by her sister Emily from 1836 to 1838. Early in her professional life she is believed to have taught at the Blue Hill Academy in Blue Hill, Maine. She is known to have been in that town in 1831, and it is thought that she may have received some instruction in watercolor painting from Jonathan Fisher, a local polymath and graduate of Harvard University. By 1835 she was in Boston, painting miniatures and giving instruction in the art as well. Clarissa married the painter Moses B. Russell, with whom she had sought instruction in painting, in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1839; their son, Albert Cuyp Russell, became an engraver and illustrator who worked with his uncle, Leopold Grozelier.The Russells were active in Boston from around 1842 to 1854, living on School Street and exhibiting work at the Boston Athenaeum; Clarissa also showed work at the Boston Artists Association, in 1842 and 1843, and at the  Art and Mechanics Associations. Her first exhibition was in 1841, at the Third Exhibition of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association; the Boston Evening Transcript gave her a favorable notice. She and her husband worked closely together, and their styles are similar enough that it is difficult to tell their work apart; furthermore, her paintings, which are often either unsigned or bear her husband's name, have sometimes been mistaken for those of Joseph Whiting Stock. Her style, which is reminiscent of that of her New England contemporaries such as William Matthew Prior, has been called by one writer "highly finished though somewhat defective in drawing"; another has spoken of her "penchant for realism in combination with decorative fabric". She appears to have specialized in portraits of children, given the numbers of these from her hand which have survived.Russell remained actively sought after as a portraitist until her death. She was buried either in the Second Burying Ground in North Andover, Massachusetts, or in Ridgewood Cemetery, also in North Andover; one of the markers is a cenotaph, but it is not known which. The latter marker honors her husband and son as well. Such was her stature that the Boston Atlas memorialized her with a front-page obituary, and notices were published in other papers as well.A self-portrait by Russell, dating to around 1850, was included in the inaugural exhibition of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, American Women Artists 1830–1930, in 1987. A portrait of a baby and dog attributed to her is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as are another portrait of a baby and a painting of the three Starbird children of Charlestown, Massachusetts; this last is the only one of the three whose attribution to her is secure. Another miniature of a child is in the Cincinnati Art Museum.  An album of watercolors of flowers and plants, likely her earliest surviving work, is currently owned by the North Andover Historical Society. Her paintings are sometimes described as having "primitive vestiges", and her work is highly sought after by collectors of folk art.== References ==
Byrdcliffe Colony	Question: question: In what country is the Byrdcliffe Colony located?

Thomas Sidney Cooper	Question: question: Where did Thomas Sidney Cooper settle in 1827?	Ref: Brussels	Pred: Brussels	Context: Thomas Sidney Cooper  (26 September 1803 – 7 February 1902) was an English landscape painter noted for his images of cattle and farm animals. Thomas Sidney Cooper was born in St Peter's Street in Canterbury, Kent, and as a small child he began to show strong artistic inclinations, but the circumstances of his family did not allow him to receive any systematic training.  By the time he was twelve years old, he was working in the shop of a coach painter. Later he obtained a job as a scene painter; and he alternated between these two occupations for about eight years. He still felt a desire to become an artist, and all his spare moments were spent drawing and painting from nature. At the age of twenty he went to London, drew for a while in the British Museum, and was admitted as a student of the Royal Academy.He then returned to Canterbury, where he was able to earn a living as a drawing-master and by the sale of sketches and drawings. In 1827 he settled in Brussels and married; there he met Eugène Joseph Verboeckhoven. Because of the Belgian Revolution he returned to London, and by showing his first picture at the Royal Academy (1833) began an unprecedentedly prolonged career as an exhibitor. When the competition was announced for the decoration for the new Houses of Parliament, to be held at Westminster Hall in 1847, Cooper submitted The Defeat of Kellermann's Cuirassiers and Carabiniers by Somerset's Cavalry Brigade at Waterloo, June 18, 1815, without success. In order to complete the picture, the artist used Siborne's model of the battlefield then on exhibition in London, while a friend in Brussels sent him breastplates worn by the various cavalry regiments, and a trooper of the Life Guards acted as a model.He is mainly associated with pictures of cattle or sheep, a fact that earned him the epithet "Cow Cooper". Cooper collaborated between 1847 and 1870 with Frederick Richard Lee R.A. on several paintings, Lee undertaking the landscapes, and Cooper adding animals to complete the scene. He was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy (ARA) in 1845 and Royal Academician (RA) on 22 June 1867. The oldest member of the Royal Academy of Arts at the time of the accession of King Edward VII in 1901, Cooper was in July 1901 received by the King in audience, and appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO).He was a great philanthropist in Canterbury, and used some of his wealth to distribute bread and coal to the poor at Christmas. The Alms Houses in Chantry Lane Canterbury are wrongly attributed to him as they were donated by Thomas Sankey Cooper and his brother Henry. Most notably in 1882 he developed his private art lessons into a full-fledged art school in Canterbury, located at his home and studio in St Peter's Street. Originally called the Canterbury Sidney Cooper School of Art, Cooper's art school is still in existence although it is now called the University for the Creative Arts. Amongst Cooper's more well-known students was Mary Tourtel, creator and illustrator of the Rupert Bear books for children.He wrote his reminiscences, under the title of My Life, in 1890. The largest public collection of Cooper paintings is owned by Canterbury City Council and housed at the Beaney House of Art & Knowledge in Canterbury. Examples are also held by the Tate Gallery, London, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and other public collections, mainly in Britain.

William Morris	Question: question: What nationality was William Morris?	Ref: British	Pred: British	Context: William Morris (24 March 1834 – 3 October 1896) was a British textile designer, poet, artist, fantasy writer, architectural conservationist, printer, translator and socialist activist associated with the British Arts and Crafts Movement. He was a major contributor to the revival of traditional British textile arts and methods of production. His literary contributions helped to establish the modern fantasy genre, while he helped win acceptance of socialism in fin de siècle Great Britain.Morris was born in Walthamstow, Essex, to a wealthy middle-class family. He came under the strong influence of medievalism while studying Classics at Oxford University, there joining the Birmingham Set. After university, he married Jane Burden, and developed close friendships with Pre-Raphaelite artists Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti and with Neo-Gothic architect Philip Webb. Webb and Morris designed Red House in Kent where Morris lived from 1859 to 1865, before moving to Bloomsbury, central London. In 1861, Morris founded the Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. decorative arts firm with Burne-Jones, Rossetti, Webb, and others, which became highly fashionable and much in demand. The firm profoundly influenced interior decoration throughout the Victorian period, with Morris designing tapestries, wallpaper, fabrics, furniture, and stained glass windows. In 1875, he assumed total control of the company, which was renamed Morris & Co.Morris rented the rural retreat of Kelmscott Manor, Oxfordshire, from 1871 while also retaining a main home in London. He was greatly influenced by visits to Iceland with Eiríkur Magnússon, and he produced a series of English-language translations of Icelandic Sagas. He also achieved success with the publication of his epic poems and novels, namely The Earthly Paradise (1868–1870), A Dream of John Ball (1888), the Utopian News from Nowhere (1890), and the fantasy romance The Well at the World's End (1896). In 1877, he founded the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings to campaign against the damage caused by architectural restoration. He was influenced by anarchism in the 1880s and became a committed revolutionary socialist activist. He founded the Socialist League in 1884 after an involvement in the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), but he broke with that organisation in 1890. In 1891, he founded the Kelmscott Press to publish limited-edition, illuminated-style print books, a cause to which he devoted his final years.Morris is recognised as one of the most significant cultural figures of Victorian Britain. He was best known in his lifetime as a poet, although he posthumously became better known for his designs. The William Morris Society founded in 1955 is devoted to his legacy, while multiple biographies and studies of his work have been published. Many of the buildings associated with his life are open to visitors, much of his work can be found in art galleries and museums, and his designs are still in production.

William Harrison Scarborough	Question: question: Where was Scarborough based when he was 1838?	Ref: Lynchburg	Pred: Lynchburg, Virginia	Context: William Harrison Scarborough (November 7, 1812 – August 16, 1871) was an American painter, active mainly as a portraitist. A native of Tennessee, he spent much of his career in South Carolina.Scarborough was born in Dover, Tennessee to John and Sally Bosworth Scarborough, whose family origins were in Scarborough, Yorkshire. He often employed a family coat of arms dating back to the Wars of the Roses; one art historian noted that he "sealed his letters with a white rose as a memento of the sympathies of his family in days gone by." His father allowed him to travel on an educational trip when he was 16; the only paintings he had seen up until that point were those in the local tavern. Around 1828 he began the study of medicine in Cincinnati, but soon decided to become an artist instead, and he is known to have worked with Horace Harding and Henry Inman in that city. He may also have come to know Dr. Daniel Drake at the same time. He underwent more thorough training in Nashville under the tutelage of John C. Grimes in 1830. He is also known to have studied and worked in Florence, Tuscumbia, Cortland, and Athens, Alabama; Kingston, Rogersville, and Knoxville, Tennessee; and Georgia. In 1838 he is recorded as working in Lynchburg, Virginia.Scarborough married Sarah Ann Gaines in Dover on October 8, 1833. She died in childbirth on March 29, 1835, and he and his infant son John left Tennessee for Alabama, before settling in Charleston, South Carolina in 1836. It was in Charleston that he was provided with his first commissions when planter and lawyer John Miller asked him to paint some of his seven daughters; the artist married one of the seven, Miranda Eliza, on November 28, 1838, and the couple lived with her parents for a time before moving. Scarborough had opened a studio in Cheraw, South Carolina in 1836, and his father-in-law's connections soon ensured a steady stream of patronage there from families such as the DuBoses, Murrells, Furmans, and Lides. This dried up by 1843, and the artist and his wife relocated to Columbia, where he would remain for the rest of his life.Scarborough soon became the preeminent portrait painter in Columbia. Barely a year after he arrived in the city, he received his most important commission to date when he was requested by the Committee of the Clariosophic Society of South Carolina College to paint John C. Calhoun; so successful was the portrait that it was requisitioned by Calhoun's son Andrew, and the Society was forced to commission another for its quarters. Other sitters included James Chesnut and Wade Hampton. He continued traveling, visiting Charleston and Nashville on business and touring Europe, stopping in London, Paris, and Rome, in 1857. He is known to have produced portrait miniatures during his career as well, although few are extant; a pair are currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He also kept meticulous account books, listing his sitters and the proceeds he received from his work. Prices for his paintings could reach upwards of $100. He is said to have worked rapidly, alternating between portraits during the day and often finishing two in a week; he seldom signed his pictures.Scarborough continued painting to the end of his life; at his death he had completed over 230 portraits and left an estate valued at $20,000, a substantial sum for the period. He was initially interred in the churchyard of Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, but was removed some years later when his wife went to live with a daughter in Ridge Spring. She had him reinterred in the Ridge Spring Cemetery, intending to be buried by his side after her death; ironically, she died on a visit to her son in Morrilton, Arkansas, and was buried there instead.Portraits by Scarborough today are found in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Morris Museum of Art, the Gibbes Museum of Art, the Columbia Museum of Art, and the University of South Carolina, among other institutions. Wofford College owns a pen-and-ink drawing of Benjamin Wofford, the school's founder. A self-portrait is held by the Florence Museum in Florence, South Carolina. The Columbia Museum of Art also holds a landscape painting by the artist, depicting the falls of the Reedy River in Greenville, South Carolina and dating to a sojourn in that town in 1840; a handful of other landscapes and still-life paintings have been identified, but the vast majority of his output is in the field of portraiture.== References ==

Morton graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1857, and became professor of physics and chemistry at the Episcopal Academy of Philadelphia in 1860. In 1863, he delivered a series of lectures on chemistry at the Franklin Institute. A year later, he was appointed resident secretary at Franklin Institute, where he continued his lectures. His lectures on light attracted attention throughout the United States and Europe by reason of his brilliant and unique experiments. He continued as resident secretary until 1870.He was one of the founders of the Philadelphia Dental College in 1863 and its first professor of chemistry. From 1867 to 1868, during the absence of John F. Frazer, he was invited to fill the chair of professor of physics and chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1869, the chair was divided, and Morton received the chemistry professorship. In 1867, he became editor of the Franklin Institute Journal. That same year, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.He conducted the photographic branch of the United States eclipse expedition to Iowa in 1869, under the auspices of the U. S. Nautical Almanac office. In addition to securing several excellent photographs of the eclipse, he proved that the bright line of the sun's disc adjacent to the moon is due to a chemical action in the process of developing the plate and not to diffraction as had hitherto been proposed by Sir George B. Airy.Also he was a member of the private expedition that was organized by Henry Draper to observe the total solar eclipse of 29 July 1878 at Rawlins, Wyoming.The degree of Ph.D. was conferred on him by Dickinson College in 1869, and by Princeton University in 1871. He was a member of scientific societies, and in 1874 was elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences, on whose commissions he has occasionally served. Besides writing numerous papers on electricity and fluorescence, he assisted in the preparation of The Student's Practical Chemistry (1868). In 1859 he made the lithographic drawings for a publication of a translation of the trilingual hieroglyphic inscription of the Rosetta Stone.In 1873 he conducted a series of researches on the "Fluorescent and Absorption Spectra of the Uranium Salts", and also on the like spectra of pyrene, and of a new material found by him in some petroleum residues to which he gave the name of thallene, from its brilliant green fluorescence. His reputation as a scientist became worldwide and his services as a chemical expert were eagerly sought in litigation. In 1878, he succeeded to the vacancy on the United States Lighthouse Board that was caused by the death of Joseph Henry, which appointment he held until 1885, conducting meanwhile investigations on fog signals, electric lighting, fire extinguishers, illuminating buoys, and like subjects, which appear in the annual reports of the Board.

Frederick Arthur Bridgman	Question: question: Who was known for his paintings of "Orientalist" subjects?	Ref: Bridgman	Pred: Frederick Arthur Bridgman	Context: Frederick Arthur Bridgman (November 10, 1847 – January 13, 1928) was an American artist  known for his paintings of  "Orientalist" subjects. Born in Tuskegee, Alabama, Bridgman was the son of a physician. He began as a draughtsman in New York City, for the American Bank Note Company in 1864–65, and studied art in the same years at the Brooklyn Art Association and at the National Academy of Design. He went to Paris in 1866, and in 1867 he entered the studio of the noted academic painter Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904), where he was deeply influenced by Gérôme's precise draftsmanship, smooth finishes, and concern for Middle-Eastern themes. Thereafter, Paris became his headquarters. In 1874, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1881.Bridgman made his first trip to North Africa between 1872 and 1874, dividing his time between Morocco tunisia and Algeria and Egypt. There he executed approximately three hundred sketches, which became the source material for several later oil paintings that attracted immediate attention. Bridgman became known as "the American Gérôme", although Bridgman would later adopt a more naturalistic aesthetic, emphasizing bright colors and painterly brushwork.His large and important composition, The funeral rites of a mummy on the Nile (1876–77; Speed Art Museum, Louisville), exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1877 and Royal Academy of Arts in 1881, bought by James Gordon Bennett, Jr., brought him the Cross of the Legion of Honor. The painting was later purchased by the famous American collector Wendell Cherry who donated it to the Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Kentucky in 1990.Additional visits to the region throughout the 1870s and 1880s allowed him to amass a collection of costumes, architectural pieces, and objets d'art, which often appear in his paintings. John Singer Sargent noted that Bridgman's overstuffed studio, along with the Eiffel Tower, were Paris's must-see attractions. Though Bridgman maintained a lifelong connection to France, his popularity in America never waned. Indeed, in 1890, the artist had a one-man show of over 400 pictures in New York's 5th Avenue galleries. When the show moved to Chicago's Art Institute, it contained only 300 works – testimony to the high number of sales Bridgman had made.

Charles Cabrier II	Question: question: Along with Germany, Sweden, and Russia, where are many of Charles Cabrier II's clocks found?	Ref: America	Pred: Britain and America	Context: Charles Cabrier II (eighteenth century) was a notable London clock and scientific instrument maker. Charles Cabrier II, son of Charles I and father of Charles III, was the most prominent clockmaker of the three namesakes.  The Cabriers were a celebrated dynasty of Huguenot clockmakers who settled in London after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685). A relatively large number of their clocks - built over a period of half a century - have survived.Apprenticed in 1719, Charles Cabrier II joined the Clockmakers' Company in 1726; he was Master from 1757 to 1772. Many examples of his work, including table clocks, carriage clocks, and pocket watches, are preserved in collections and museums in Britain and America, Germany, Sweden, and Russia.
Lawrence Kilburn	Question: question: When did Kilburn arrive in New York?	Ref: May	Pred: May, 1754	Context: Lawrence Kilburn (sometimes Kilbrunn or Kilbourn) (1720–1775) was a painter active in the colony of New York. He was for nearly twenty years the portraitist of choice in New York City, and is said to have been the first portraitist in the city.Kilburn is said by at least one source to have been a Moravian of Danish birth. He arrived in New York from London in May, 1754, on the brig Maria captained by Thomas Miller, and immediately announced his presence in the New York Gazette and the New York Weekly. His first advertisement, which ran on May 13, 1754, read:Lawrence Kilburn, Limner, just arrived from London with Capt. Miller, hereby acquaints all Gentlemen and Ladies inclined to favour him in having their Pictures drawn, that he don't doubt of pleasing them in taking a true Likeness, and finishing the Drapery in a proper Manner, as also in the Choice of Attitudes, suitable to each Person's Age and Sex, and giving agreeable Satisfaction, as he has heretofore done to Gentlemen and Ladies in London. He may at present be apply'd to at his Lodgings, at Mr. Bogart's, near the New Printing-Office in Beaver-Street.He would go on to move numerous times while he lived in the city, and at the time of his death was keeping a paint store at the White Hall.The nature of Kilbrun's training is unknown, although it has been speculated that, due to his somewhat limited understanding of human anatomy and his abilities as a painter of clothing, he had worked as a drapery painter prior to emigration. He placed six advertisements in the local press between 1754 and 1775; this was more than any other colonial artist. As with many colonial painters, he offered many services; he invited commissions, offered drawing instruction, and sold painting supplies, and he is known to have done decorative painting at least once. He also identified himself in advertising as a painter of portrait miniatures. He chafed sometimes at the reluctance of his audience; in 1765, prior to leaving the city for a time, he reminded them that "As at present there is no other Portrait painter in the city but himself; whoever inclines to have anything done of that kind, are desired to apply in time, as it may be long before they have another opportunity."Kilburn received a license to marry on June 24, 1761; his wife's name was Judith Eyraud or Ayraud. He was one of at least ten painters working in New York during the 1760s, and by 1766 found himself competing with various others for custom. Abraham Delanoy, newly returned from studying in London with Benjamin West, was one; John Mare was another, as were John Durand and Cosmo Alexander. Earlier patrons began to abandon him at this point, and it appears from newspaper advertisements that he turned exclusively to mercantile pursuits during the last years of his life. He was dead by September 21, 1775, when an advertisement in Rivington's N. Y. Gazetteer invited patrons to settle their accounts with his widow and executrix. Kilburn's handwritten memoir is preserved at the Moravian Archives, Bethlehem, appearing in the diary of First Moravian Church of New York, where he was a regular church member. After Laurence's death, Judith moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and her handwritten memoir is likewise preserved among the records of the Moravian Church in Bethlehem.Kilburn favored a sober palette. Few of his pictures are signed or dated. The New York Historical Society holds a number of examples of his work, including several portraits of members of the Beekman family and one of Gerardus Stuydevant which was shown at the Centennial Exposition of 1876. Another portrait is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A portrait of Samuel Johnson, first president of Columbia University, is owned by the Century Club, to which it was donated by the artist himself sometime before 1757.

From 1848-1851 he was a partner in the business, and when his father retired, Moore inherited the business.  Moore was  a highly successful silversmith when he entered an exclusive contract with Tiffany & Co. under which he would work exclusively for Tiffany's as an independent, outside craftsman.  In 1868 he  joined the firm, working as the firm's chief silver designer until his death 1891.  Moore  made many improvements in manufacturing processes, adding flatware to Tiffany's silver catalog in 1869. He won a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle in 1867 for his exhibit of silverware, another medal at the Centennial Exposition in 1876, and a special gold medal in 1878 in Paris. In 1889 he was awarded the Legion of Honor. He died in his summer house at Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.Moore amassed a notable collection of art, with a focus on art from Japan, the Islamic world and ancient Greece and Rome.   His collection contains somewhere between 1,600 and 1,700 pieces. He first began to study objects to help inform his designs, and subsequently began to collect them. At one time he devoted his attention to Japanese and Chinese porcelains, and later old Persian wares. Over time he became interested in old glass and lusterware porcelains which now form an especially rich part of the collection. His collection includes antique Roman, Cyprian, Etruscan, Merovingian, Venetian, Persian, Arab, German, and Spanish glass; Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hispano-Moresque, Rhodian, Damascus, and Persian ceramics; Persian, Turkish, and Indian metalwork, including Saracenic metal work of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, as well as Chinese and Japanese bronzes, swords and sword-guards; Japanese inro, netsuke, lacquer ware, and wood and ivory carvings; and Oriental jewelry, Persian lacquer, antique French and Venetian inlaid straw work, and a fine collection of Tanagra figurines.He bequeathed many objects from his collection to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which will host an exhibit of Moore's work in 2020, describes Moore as "the creative force who led Tiffany & Co. to unparalleled originality and success during the second half of the nineteenth century."

He led the Liberal-National Coalition to defeat at the 1993 Australian federal election.Hewson was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and earned a PhD in Economics from Johns Hopkins University. He has also attained degrees from the University of Sydney and the University of Regina. Before entering politics, Hewson worked as an economist for the Reserve Bank of Australia, an economic advisor to the Fraser Government, a business journalist, and a director of Macquarie Bank.In 1987, Hewson was elected to the House of Representatives. He was appointed to the shadow cabinet in 1988, serving under John Howard and Andrew Peacock. After Peacock lost the 1990 election, Hewson was elected leader of the Liberal Party in his place, thus becoming Leader of the Opposition. In 1991, he launched the Fightback! policy manifesto, which proposed a series of major economic reforms with a goods and services tax (GST) as its centrepiece.Political platforms in the 1993 federal election focused mainly on economic policy, especially on how Australia should respond to the early 1990s recession. The Labor Party – led by Paul Keating – had been in power for 10 years at that point, but many polls suggested a Coalition victory. However, Labor was able to mount a successful countercampaign, with the party's net increase in seats allowing Keating to remain prime minister. Hewson continued on as Liberal leader for another year, losing a leadership spill to Alexander Downer in 1994. He left parliament the following year. Since then, Hewson has continued to be a public expert in business and political commentary. He resigned his Liberal Party membership in 2019, having been a critic of its policy direction for a number of years, particularly on climate change.

Everett Shinn	Question: question: Who was the only Ashcan artist who preferred to work in pastels?	Ref: Shinn	Pred: Shinn	Context: Everett Shinn (November 6, 1876 – May 1, 1953) was an American painter and member of the urban realist Ashcan School.Shinn started as a newspaper illustrator in Philadelphia, demonstrating a rare facility for depicting animated movement, a skill that would, however, soon be eclipsed by photography. Here he worked with William J. Glackens, George Luks and John Sloan, who became core-members of the Ashcan School, led by Robert Henri, which defied official good taste in favour of robust images of real life. Shinn is best known for scenes of disaster or street violence, as well as theatrical subjects, regarding the theatre as a place of satisfying illusion. Shinn was the only Ashcan artist who preferred to work in pastels. He was reportedly a model for the protagonist of Theodore Dreiser's  novel The "Genius".

Together with a small team of enthusiastic followers, he pioneered the Ashcan School of American realism, depicting urban life in an uncompromisingly brutalist style. By the time of the Armory Show, America's first large-scale introduction to European Modernism (1913), Henri was mindful that his own representational technique was being made to look dated by new movements such as Cubism, though he was still ready to champion avant-garde painters such as Henri Matisse and Max Weber.Henri was named as one of the top three living American artists by the Arts Council of New York.

Bill Traylor	Question: question: Who was a prominent artist in the field of self-taught and modern art?	Ref: Traylor	Pred: William Traylor	Context: William Traylor  (April 1, c. 1853 – October 23, 1949) was an African-American  self-taught artist from Lowndes County, Alabama. Born into slavery, Traylor spent the majority of his life after emancipation as a sharecropper. It was only after 1939, following his move to Montgomery, Alabama, that Traylor began to draw. At the age of 85, he took up a pencil and a scrap of cardboard to document his recollections and observations. From 1939 to 1942, while working on the sidewalks of Montgomery, he produced nearly 1,500 pieces of art.While Traylor received his first public exhibition in 1940, it was not until 30 years after his death that his work finally began to receive broader attention, in the late 1970s. Recent acceptance of Traylor as a significant figure of American folk and modern art has been founded on the efforts of Charles Shannon, as well as the evolving tastes of the art world. Shannon, who first encountered Traylor's work in 1940, brought Traylor to the attention of the larger art world.  Traylor now holds a central position in the fields of "self-taught" and modern art.

C. S. Price	Question: question: Where did Clayton Sumner "C.S." Price come from?	Ref: Oregon	Pred: Oregon	Context: Clayton Sumner "C. S." Price (1874 – 1950) was an American expressionist painter from Oregon. Price was born on May 11, 1874 near Bedford, Iowa, and raised on farms and ranches there and in Wyoming and Alberta, Canada. In 1905, a local rancher loaned Price money so he could attend the St. Louis School of Fine Arts.  Price attended the school during the 1905–1906 academic year; it would be his only formal training. In 1909, Price moved to Portland, Oregon to work as an illustrator for The Pacific Monthly magazine.  Price's illustrations of the magazine's Western stories were reminiscent of the work of Charles Marion Russell. Price left Portland in 1910, painting and working for room and board on the farms and ranches of his siblings in British Columbia and California for the next eight years.  Price visited Monterey, California in 1918. Price returned to Portland in 1929. During the 1930s, Price completed a series of large paintings as part of the Public Works of Art Project and the Federal Art Project. These works currently are displayed in Timberline Lodge, the Multnomah County Library, Pendleton High School, and the Portland Art Museum. He died on May 1, 1950.Price's long tenure in the San Francisco Bay Area and on the Monterey Peninsula had the most profound impact on the development of his art.  He visited San Francisco for the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in the spring of 1915 and decided to stay.  The following January he displayed two "remarkable" studies of domestic animals at the Exhibition of California Artists at the Memorial Museum.  This was soon followed by an exhibit of "pastoral scenes" at Helgesen's Gallery.  From 1917 to 1920 he studied as an occasional student at the California School of Fine Arts (today's San Francisco Art Institute) under Pedro Joseph de Lemos, Lee F. Randolph and Frank van Sloun, and was awarded a second prize at the school's annual exhibit in 1920.  According to the U.S. Census that year he was unmarried and resided in San Francisco near his mentor and teacher, the renowned artist Gottardo Piazzoni.By 1921 he was sharing a Monterey studio and residential address with artist William Gaskin and the Fauvist painter August Gay, a member of the Society of Six, at the old French Hotel, known as the Stevenson House.  Price was first described as a very quiet "Bible-reading man" who painted illustrative cowboy scenes.  He earned money by working at the local cannery and making picture frames.  He studied with the popular Post-Impressionist painter Armin Hansen.  In April 1922 he was one of three Monterey artists invited by Pedro Joseph de Lemos to exhibit at Stanford University, where, according to one critic, his ten displayed works were reminiscent of Frederic Remington.  Shortly thereafter he exhibited at the: Del Monte Art Gallery (Monterey); Carmel Arts and Crafts Club; and California Gallery of American Art (San Francisco).By 1924 his art had changed radically and the press now described his works as having simplified compositions, blocks of either crude or harmonious colors, and juxtaposed planes that rendered distorted perspectives.  His art was attracting wealthy buyers.  At this time he was in a very public and romantic relationship with the artist Ina Perham.  In the summer of 1925 his decidedly Expressionist canvases, along with his earlier paintings, were given a one-man show at San Francisco's Galerie des Beaux Arts.  When critics evaluated his new works, they called him a "colorist" with no interest in drawing, but they also claimed that he "set a high mark for Modernists."  His huge scaled model of the town of "old Monterey" was displayed on the Peninsula.In 1927 Price spent so much time in Berkeley and contributed to so many exhibits in the University town that he became a cult figure in the local art colony.  That January his one-month show at the Berkeley League of Fine Arts attracted so much interest and so many students that it was extended into April; critics were enthralled by his purity, rhythm and progressive forms.Ten of Hansen's most reformist students formed the somewhat amorphous "Monterey Group," which included Price and Perham, and in May 1927 staged a highly publicized exhibit at the Galerie des Beaux Arts.  Although much of the exhibit was panned, Price's canvas entitled Ploughing was called "quite an achievement." That summer a jury accepted his art for the exhibit at the California State Fair.  Although he moved to Portland in 1929 he maintained an active schedule of exhibitions in northern California.

She was able to capture the excitement of winter's first snow, Thanksgiving preparations and the new, young green of oncoming spring... In person, Grandma Moses charmed wherever she went. A tiny, lively woman with mischievous gray eyes and a quick wit, she could be sharp-tongued with a sycophant and stern with an errant grandchild."She was a live-in housekeeper for a total of 15 years, starting at age 12. An employer noticed her appreciation for their prints made by Currier and Ives, and they supplied her with drawing materials. Moses and her husband began their married life in Virginia, where they worked on farms. In 1905, they returned to the Northeastern United States and settled in Eagle Bridge, New York. They had ten children, five of whom survived infancy. She embroidered pictures with yarn, until disabled by arthritis.

Rudolf Staffel	Question: question: Where did Hans Hoffmann live?	Ref: New York	Pred: New York	Context: Rudolf Harry "Rudi" Staffel (1911 – 2002) was an American ceramic artist and educator. Rudolf Staffel was born in 1911 in San Antonio, Texas. Staffel attended Brackenridge High School. Staffel initially wanted to be a painter, and early on attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. While there, an exhibition of Wiener Werkstätte at the Field Museum of History, captivated him with its glass art.Staffel briefly moved to Mexico to study glass blowing, and while there he fell in love with ceramics at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. His early ceramics were in a mid-century studio style, with traditional forms and glazes, although sometimes with social commentary and often with references to Native American, Asian and Scandinavian ceramic traditions. In the 1940s, he studied with Hans Hoffmann in New York, who instilled in him a strong sense of "push/pull" pictorial content that would later come to maturity in his Light Gatherers.  Circa 1954-1955, Staffel turned from stoneware to porcelain as the result of a dinnerware commission he was given.By the late 1950s, Staffel worked exclusively in porcelain. His Light Gatherers, as they would become known, would occupy Staffel for the rest of his career.  The ability of a work to hold and transmit light was the most important quality for him. "Even when I was a painter, I was always interest in light," he said. "Something about light coming through glass, wax, or snow. I wanted to achieve a passage of light."Staffel made his own porcelain compositions in an effort to achieve the maximum translucency, the same as with glass or paint. He also manipulated the material via piercing, stretching, folding and even engraving.  His works are almost exclusively white, are rarely glazed, and when he occasionally adds color it is limited to blue, green or, rarely, red tones that come from metal oxides.Staffel taught at the Tyler School of Art in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania from 1940, until his retirement in 1978. While there, he mentored artists including Paula Winokur, and John E. Dowell Jr.Staffel died in 2002 in Alfred, New York. His daughter is writer Megan Staffel.

Edwin Scheier	Question: question: Where did Mary Scheier work when she married?	Ref: Big Stone Gap Federal Art Gallery	Pred: Big Stone Gap Federal Art Gallery	Context: Edwin Scheier (November 11, 1910 – April 20, 2008) was an American artist, best known for his ceramic works with his wife, Mary Scheier. Edwin Scheier was born in The Bronx, New York, to a Jewish German immigrant father, and an American mother. Scheier's father died shortly after his son's birth. Although his mother remarried, Scheier was left to his own devices, and dropped out of school before high school, in order to make a living. During the Great Depression, he criss-crossed the nation before returning to New York City.Although never formally trained, Scheier attended free seminars at Cooper Union, and also worked for a silversmith and a ceramicist. He often examined works in the city's museums, and first, and briefly, met his future wife, Mary Goldsmith, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A period as a public puppeteer led him to take a position teaching crafts through the WPA. This led to other positions in the WPA, and it was through one of these roles, as a field supervisor of craft programs, that he again met Mary, who was directing a ceramics studio at the Big Stone Gap Federal Art Gallery in Abingdon, Virginia. They were married on August 19, 1937, eventually resigned their posts with the WPA, and after a period as itinerant puppeteers, established a long-term partnership as fine ceramicists.

Gaspare Mola	Question: question: Who did Gasparo Molo make medals for?	Ref: Urban VIII	Pred: Urban VIII, Innocent X, and Alexander VII	Context: Gasparo Molo (also spelt Mola or Moli) was an Italian goldsmith and planisher, chiefly known as a medalist, whose biography is very obscure.Born (according to Forrer) in Breglia near Como or (according to older records) in Lugano, his date of death is unknown. He was first active in Milan, then in Mantua, from 1608 in Florence, from which latter period we possess his first signed medal. Here he was maestro delle stampe della monete. In 1609 he became well known by his medals commemorating the marriage and the accession of Cosimo II. In 1609 and 1610 he cut the dies for the thalers and the "medals of merit" conferred by the grand duke. According to Kenner, it is not necessary to suppose that he gave up his connexion with the Florentine court at this time, because, in the following years, he struck medals for the court in Mantua, as well as coins for Guastalla and Castiglione, especially as he was again working in Florence in 1614 (certainly in 1615). The medals, which he made after 1620 for Prince Vincenzo II of Mantua, may very well also have been struck at Florence.His further sojourn in Tuscany seems to have been rendered distasteful to him by intrigues. About 1623 he moved to Rome, where he became die-cutter at the Papal mint in place of J. A. Moro, who died in 1625. Here he made a great many coins and medals for Urban VIII (1623–44), Innocent X (1644–55), and Alexander VII (1655–57). His last works date from 1664. As it seems strange that Molo should, at the age of eighty-four, still continue working with unabated strength, it is thought that another artist of his name - perhaps his son - continued Gasparo's work. Indeed, we find in 1639 a G. D. Molo, who might have been a son of Gasparo and who apparently died young; but it is more likely that Gasparo founded a school in Rome, and that his engravers worked according to his instructions and in his style, but passed off their works under his name and with his signature.One of his numerous pupils was his successor at the Mint, Hamerani (Hameran, a German), the founder of the long-lived Hamerani family of artists. As long as cast medals were generally used, public interest in the portrait predominated, and the reverse was usually neglected; this changed with the introduction of the stamping technique. We know only a few cast medals of Molo; he preferred the stamped medal. It seems that he was responsible for new ideas in stamping technique.
Filippo Negroli	Question: question: What was the name of the brother of Filippo Negroli?	Ref: Francesco	Pred: Francesco	Context: Filippo Negroli (ca. 1510–1579) was an armourer from Milan. He was renowned as being extremely skilled, and may be considered the most famous armourer of all time. Working together with his younger brothers Giovan Battista (ca. 1511–1591) and Francesco (ca. 1522–1600) in the Negroli family workshop headed by their father Gian Giacomo Negroli (ca. 1463–1543), Filippo was specialized in repoussé of armour, whereas his brother Francesco was renowned for his damascening skills. Filippo's pieces are considered especially remarkable because they were wrought in steel, rather than the more-easily worked iron that was the traditionally assumed medium.He made parade armour for several esteemed clients, including Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Guidobaldo II della Rovere.Examples of his work include:Burgonet of Charles V at La Real Armería, Madrid, Spain.Burgonet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Burgonet at the Wallace Collection.Burgonet "Alla Romana Antica" at Kunsthistorisches Museum.

They competed for fame and noble patronage with the other two most prominent late 15th century European armour smith families, the Seusenhofers of Innsbruck (Austria) and the Missaglias of Milan.Many works that the Helmschmieds made for Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Philip II of Spain are preserved in the Royal Armoury of Madrid, and many of their other works are kept in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.
Jean Bérain the Elder	Question: question: Who was commissioned to design the exterior decoration of the king's ships after his death?	Ref: Charles Le Brun Berain	Pred: Charles Le Brun Berain	Context: Jean Berain the Elder (1640 – 24 January 1711) was a draughtsman and designer, painter and engraver of ornament, the artistic force in the Royal office of the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi where all the designs originated for court spectacle, from fêtes to funerals, and many designs for furnishings not covered by the Bâtiments du Roi. The "Berainesque" style of light arabesques and playful grotesques was an essential element in the style Régence that led to the French Rocaille and European Rococo.Born in Saint-Mihiel, Meuse, in the Austrian Netherlands, he was the son of a master gunsmith, in whose line of work engraving was a prominent technique. He spent his career in Paris. Long after his death the connoisseur Pierre-Jean Mariette wrote of him, "Nothing was done, in whatever genre that it might have been, unless it were in his manner, or where he had given designs for it." Through his engravings and those of his son, his style was highly influential beyond the court and Paris, notably in the Low Countries, Germany and London. His close friendship with Nicodemus Tessin the Younger ensured that Berain's own nuance in the Louis XIV style was transmitted to court circles in Sweden.Berain was established in Paris by 1663. On 28 December 1674 he was appointed dessinateur de la Chambre et du cabinet du Roi (designer of the king's chamber and office) in the Menus-Plaisirs (a post he retained until his death), in succession to Henri de Gissey, whose pupil he is believed to have been. From 1677 onward he had workrooms and an apartment in the Galeries du Louvre near to those of André Charles Boulle, for whom he made many designs for furniture. After the death of Charles Le Brun Berain was commissioned to compose and supervise the whole of the exterior decoration of the king's ships. His first designs for royal interiors date from the years 1682–1684.He was inventive and industrious, and, beginning with interiors at the Hôtel de Mailly (1687–88) assimilated and adapted Raphaelesque grotesque ornament to the taste of the time. He provided arabesque designs for the manufacture of Beauvais tapestry. At Meudon for Louis, le Grand Dauphin, whose favourite designer he remained. Berain's decors, beginning in 1699, initiated the Régence style that was a precursor of the Rococo.Bérain also designed for the theatre. By 1674 he had already begun designing costumes for Jean-Baptiste Lully's Opéra, including costumes for dancers in the divertissements. For Lully's 1684 opera Amadis, a tale of chivalric romance, Bérain carried out research into the styles of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, a historical approach to costume design that was unusual for the time. Besides costume designs for Lully's tragédies en musique, Bérain designed the costumes for Lully's ballets Le triomphe de l'amour (1681) and Le temple de la paix (1685).In 1680 he additionally took over Carlo Vigarani's work as the designer of the Opéra's stage machinery and scenery, and until 1707 he was in charge of staging all lyric works produced at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in Paris as well as at the royal residences. After Lully's death in 1687, he created designs for the earliest opéra-ballets, Pascal Colasse's Les saisons (1695) and André Campra's L'Europe galante (1697). In his set designs Bérain continued using highly symmetrical single-point perspective, following in the footsteps of his Italian predecessors Giacomo Torelli and Vigarani, as well as Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi and Giovanni Burnacini. He never employed the per angolo (oblique) perspective designs that were being tried in Italy by designers such as the Galli-Bibienas.In 1692 it was Bérain who worked with the Royal Family on the occasion of the marriage of Philippe d'Orléans to the kings illegitimate daughter Françoise-Marie de Bourbon, Mademoiselle de Blois. Bérain designed their jewelled wedding clothes and their private apartments at the Palais-Royal in the Capital.His numerous designs were for the most part engraved under his own supervision; a collection of them was published in Paris in 1711 by his son-in-law, Jacques Thuret, clockmaker to the king from 1694. There are three books, L'Œuvre de J. Berain, Ornements inventés par J. Berain and Œuvres de J. Berain contenant des ornements d'architecture.Désiré Guilmard in Les Maîtres ornemanistes, gives a complete list of his published works.His son and pupil, Jean Berain the Younger (1678–1726), was born and died in Paris. He exercised the same official functions after his father's death and worked in a very similar taste.

Three suits of similar design were made by Seusenhofer, but only the armour given to Maximilian's grandson, the future Emperor Charles V, survives intact in Vienna. Henry's armour no longer survives and, because of its extraordinary appearance, the horned helmet was thought to have been that of the jester Will Somers.

In 1552 he was appointed to the royal mint, where he would have produced metalwork designs. However, he left this position after six months following a dispute about wages. During his employment at the mint, Delaune had been able to build links with the French court and king. This allowed him to obtain royal commissions in particular for the design of intricately detailed royal armour, medals and other metalwork.He commenced his career as an engraver of medals, and is said to have been helped by Benvenuto Cellini, who was at that time living in Paris. He afterwards engraved many prints after Raphael, and the Italian masters of Fontainebleau, and still more after the designs of his son Jean, with whom he passed the greater part of his life at Strassburg. His style was formed upon that of the Little Masters of Germany. He died at Strassburg in 1595.Étienne Delaune was one of the most famous designers of goldsmithery of his time. There are six of his designs in the Louvre; two of them are for circular dishes representing the Histories of Moses and of Samson. His prints, which are generally small, are very numerous; they are executed entirely with the graver, with great dexterity of handling, and are very highly finished. He copied some of the prints of Marc Antonio with success. He usually marked his prints with the initial of his Christian name, S., or S. F., or S. fecit, but sometimes Stephanus, fecit.

He also worked in woodcut. Although his etchings were widely ignored by art historians for years, more recent scholarship is crediting him and his work with "single-handedly establishing the salability of etchings" and introducing the print publisher business model.Unlike most later prints, etched on copper plates, Hopfer's printed etching continued to use the iron plates he was used to working with in steel plate armour, the material he was trained in, and with which he continued to work.

Josiah Wedgwood	Question: question: Who was the founder of the Wedgwood company?	Ref: Wedgwood	Pred: Josiah Wedgwood	Context: Josiah Wedgwood  (12 July 1730 – 3 January 1795) was an English potter, entrepreneur and abolitionist. Founding the Wedgwood company in 1759, he developed improved pottery bodies by systematic experimentation, and was the leader in the industrialisation of the manufacture of European pottery.The renewed classical enthusiasms of the late 1760s and early 1770s were of major importance to his sales promotion. His expensive goods were in much demand from the upper classes, while he used emulation effects to market cheaper sets to the rest of society. Every new invention that Wedgwood produced – green glaze, creamware, black basalt, and jasperware – was quickly copied. Having once achieved efficiency in production, he obtained efficiencies in sales and distribution. His showrooms in London gave the public the chance to see his complete range of tableware.Wedgwood's company never made porcelain during his lifetime, but specialised in fine earthenwares and stonewares that had many of the same qualities, but were considerably cheaper.  He made great efforts to keep the designs of his wares in tune with current fashion.   He was an early adopter of transfer printing which gave similar effects to hand-painting for a far lower cost. Meeting the demands of the consumer revolution that helped drive the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Wedgwood is credited as a pioneer of modern marketing. He pioneered direct mail, money back guarantees, self-service, free delivery, buy one get one free, and illustrated catalogues.A prominent abolitionist fighting slavery, Wedgwood is remembered too for his Am I Not a Man And a Brother? anti-slavery medallion. He was a member of the Darwin–Wedgwood family, and he was the grandfather of Charles and Emma Darwin.

The tsuba was noted as a reflection of the specific time period and school that designed them. Goto family work features a finely granulated ground texture called nanako which resembles fine rows of caviare. Nanako actually means 'fish-eggs'. The primary alloy they used was shakudo, a mixture of copper and a few percent of gold. This alloy was treated in a bath of copper salts to develop a lustrous black patina. This black background, with inlaid details in gold and silver, is characteristic of the family's work and was copied by many less prestigious workshops. Although he never signed his work many piece attributed to him are extant today.

Jacques-Louis David	Question: question: Who was the First Consul of France?	Ref: Napoleon	Pred: Napoleon	Context: Jacques-Louis David (French: [ʒaklwi david]; 30 August 1748 – 29 December 1825) was a French painter in the Neoclassical style, considered to be the preeminent painter of the era. In the 1780s, his cerebral brand of history painting marked a change in taste away from Rococo frivolity toward classical austerity and severity and heightened feeling, harmonizing with the moral climate of the final years of the Ancien Régime.David later became an active supporter of the French Revolution and friend of Maximilien Robespierre (1758–1794), and was effectively a dictator of the arts under the French Republic. Imprisoned after Robespierre's fall from power, he aligned himself with yet another political regime upon his release: that of Napoleon, the First Consul of France. At this time he developed his Empire style, notable for its use of warm Venetian colours. After Napoleon's fall from Imperial power and the Bourbon revival, David exiled himself to Brussels, then in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, where he remained until his death. David had many pupils, making him the strongest influence in French art of the early 19th century, especially academic Salon painting.
Louis-Nicolas Flobert	Question: question: Who invented the first rimfire metallic cartridge?	Ref: Frenchman Louis-Nicolas Flobert	Pred: Louis-Nicolas Flobert	Context: Frenchman Louis-Nicolas Flobert (1819–1894) invented the first rimfire metallic cartridge in 1845. It was a major innovation in firearms ammunition, previously delivered as separate bullets and powder. The rimfire cartridge combined both elements in a single metallic (usually brass) cartridge containing a percussion cap, powder and a bullet, in one weatherproof package. Before that, a "cartridge" was simply a pre-measured quantity of gunpowder together with a ball (bullet), in a small cloth bag (or rolled paper cylinder) which also acted as wadding for the charge and ball.
Hans Holbein the Younger	Question: question: Who was the patron of Hans Holbein the Younger?	Ref: Thomas Cromwell	Pred: Anne Boleyn and Thomas Cromwell	Context: Hans Holbein the Younger (UK:  HOL-byne, US:  HOHL-byne, HAWL-; German: Hans Holbein der Jüngere; c. 1497 – between 7 October and 29 November 1543) was a German-Swiss painter and printmaker who worked in a Northern Renaissance style, and is considered one of the greatest portraitists of the 16th century. He also produced religious art, satire, and Reformation propaganda, and he made a significant contribution to the history of book design. He is called "the Younger" to distinguish him from his father Hans Holbein the Elder, an accomplished painter of the Late Gothic school.Holbein was born in Augsburg but worked mainly in Basel as a young artist. At first, he painted murals and religious works, and designed stained glass windows and illustrations for books from the printer Johann Froben. He also painted an occasional portrait, making his international mark with portraits of humanist Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. When the Reformation reached Basel, Holbein worked for reformist clients while continuing to serve traditional religious patrons. His Late Gothic style was enriched by artistic trends in Italy, France, and the Netherlands, as well as by Renaissance humanism. The result was a combined aesthetic uniquely his own.Holbein travelled to England in 1526 in search of work with a recommendation from Erasmus. He was welcomed into the humanist circle of Thomas More, where he quickly built a high reputation. He returned to Basel for four years, then resumed his career in England in 1532 under the patronage of Anne Boleyn and Thomas Cromwell. By 1535, he was King's Painter to Henry VIII of England. In this role, he produced portraits and festive decorations, as well as designs for jewellery, plate, and other precious objects. His portraits of the royal family and nobles are a record of the court in the years when Henry was asserting his supremacy over the Church of England.Holbein's art was prized from early in his career. French poet and reformer Nicholas Bourbon (the elder) dubbed him "the Apelles of our time," a typical accolade at the time. Holbein has also been described as a great "one-off" in art history since he founded no school. Some of his work was lost after his death, but much was collected and he was recognized among the great portrait masters by the 19th century. Recent exhibitions have also highlighted his versatility. He created designs ranging from intricate jewellery to monumental frescoes.Holbein's art has sometimes been called realist, since he drew and painted with a rare precision. His portraits were renowned in their time for their likeness, and it is through his eyes that many famous figures of his day are pictured today, such as Erasmus and More. He was never content with outward appearance, however; he embedded layers of symbolism, allusion, and paradox in his art, to the lasting fascination of scholars. In the view of art historian Ellis Waterhouse, his portraiture "remains unsurpassed for sureness and economy of statement, penetration into character, and a combined richness and purity of style".

William Burges	Question: question: What was the first major commission Burges won?	Ref: Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral	Pred: Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral	Context: William Burges  (; 2 December 1827 – 20 April 1881) was an English architect and designer. Among the greatest of the Victorian art-architects, he sought in his work to escape from both nineteenth-century industrialisation and the Neoclassical architectural style and re-establish the architectural and social values of a utopian medieval England. Burges stands within the tradition of the Gothic Revival, his works echoing those of the Pre-Raphaelites and heralding those of the Arts and Crafts movement.Burges's career was short but illustrious; he won his first major commission for Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral in Cork in 1863 when he was 35. He died in 1881 at his Kensington home,  The Tower House aged only 53. His architectural output was small but varied. Working with a long-standing team of craftsmen, he built churches, a cathedral, a warehouse, a university, a school, houses and castles.Burges's most notable works are Cardiff Castle, constructed between 1866 and 1928, and Castell Coch (1872–91), both of which were built for John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute. Other significant buildings include Gayhurst House, Buckinghamshire (1858–65), Knightshayes Court (1867–74), the Church of Christ the Consoler (1870–76), St Mary's, Studley Royal (1870–78), in Yorkshire, and Park House, Cardiff (1871–80).Many of his designs were never executed or were subsequently demolished or altered. His competition entries for cathedrals at Lille (1854), Adelaide (1856), Colombo, Brisbane (1859), Edinburgh (1873), and Truro (1878) were all unsuccessful. He lost out to George Edmund Street in the competition for the Royal Courts of Justice (1866–67) in The Strand. His plans for the redecoration of the interior of St Paul's Cathedral (1870–77) were abandoned and he was dismissed from his post. Skilbeck's Warehouse (1865–66) was demolished in the 1970s, and work at Salisbury Cathedral (1855–59), Worcester College, Oxford (1873–79), and at Knightshayes Court had been lost in the decades before.Beyond architecture, Burges designed metalwork, sculpture, jewellery, furniture and stained glass. Art Applied to Industry, a series of lectures he gave to the Society of Arts in 1864, illustrates the breadth of his interests; the topics covered including glass, pottery, brass and iron, gold and silver, furniture, the weaver's art and external architectural decoration. For most of the century following his death, Victorian architecture was neither the subject of intensive study nor sympathetic attention and Burges's work was largely ignored. The revival of interest in Victorian art, architecture, and design in the later twentieth century led to a renewed appreciation of Burges and his work.

Stephen W. Shaw was born December 15, 1817 at Windsor, Vermont, to Seth and Elizabeth Barrett Shaw, descendants of Puritans and American Revolutionaries. As a young adult, Shaw taught drawing and penmanship at Norwich Military Academy, and in Wooster, Ohio between 1841-1842, Shaw advertised to execute portraits in Crayon in Wooster, Ohio in September 1842, then became an art teacher and director of the Boston Athenaeum before moving to the American South and making his living as an itinerant portraitist. In 1845, shortly after opening a studio in Lexington, Kentucky, Shaw painted his first known oil portrait. A year later, in Baton Rouge, Shaw painted a portrait of General Zachary Taylor which won a silver medal at the American Institute. In 1848, Shaw was commissioned for $1,000 by the City of New Orleans for a portrait of native son Persifer F. Smith. Shaw traveled to Veracruz and Mexico City, painting the portrait on his return to New Orleans.Joining the California Gold Rush, Shaw left New Orleans aboard the merchant steamer Isthmus, on April 21, 1849. After crossing the Isthmus of Panama, he booked passage on the Dutch bark, Alexander von Humboldt, which left Panama on May 20, 1849. Becalmed for five weeks, they reached Acapulco July 6 where the passengers forced the owners off the boat due to poor provisioning and overcrowding. After more than three months voyage, the ship finally arrived in San Francisco, August 30, 1849 and was sold for $17,000 to satisfy the passengers' lien against the owners. One of the other passengers, Collis P. Huntington, formed an association of the 365 survivors of the 102-day passage, called "The Society of the Humboldter." Huntington sponsored reunions and at least one commemorative poster; the last four members met on August 30, 1899.Contrary to at least one published report, neither ships' manifest lists Shaw's brother Seth Shaw who was elsewhere reported to have crossed the country overland in 1850. Huntington, a large group of fellow passengers, and Stephen Shaw immediately went to the gold mines at Mormon Island for about six months, then Shaw moved to Sacramento for February and March 1850, where he met future judge Edwin B. Crocker, brother of railroad baron Charles Crocker, for whom he would paint more than 25 portraits of notable Californians.

Frustrated by his failure to find a patron, Shitao converted to Daoism in 1693 and returned to Yangzhou where he remained until his death in 1707. In his late years, he is said to have greeted the Kangxi Emperor while the latter was visiting Yangzhou.

Guan Xiu	Question: question: Who rose to prominence as a Chan painter after Guanxiu died?	Ref: Shi Ke	Pred: Shi Ke	Context: Guanxiu (simplified Chinese: 贯休; traditional Chinese: 貫休; pinyin: Guànxiū; Wade–Giles: Kuan-hsiu) was a celebrated Buddhist monk, painter, poet, and calligrapher. His greatest works date from the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The collapse of the central Tang government in 907, meant artists and craftsmen lost their most powerful patrons. The imperial Tang court had inspired a golden age of literature and art at its apogee. The various provincial courts who claimed to represent a continuation of the tradition of Tang government also claimed continuity in the arts and culture. The state of the Former Shu had acted as the traditional western sanctuary ever since Emperor Xuanzong had sought refuge there during the An Shi Rebellion in 755. By the collapse of the Tang Dynasty something like a miniature Tang court existed at Chengdu. Guanxiu arrived in chengdu in 901, and remained there until his death.Wang Jian, the founding emperor of the Former Shu, bestowed upon him the honorific title Great Master of the Chan Moon (Chanyue dashi), however he is still known by his monk's name Guanxiu, which means "a string of blessings". He is famed for his depiction of arhats, disciples of historical Buddha, who lived harsh ascetic lives. He is however also known for his works in poetry and calligraphy as well; extant works exist for all three forms.After Guanxiu's death, Shi Ke rose to prominence as a Chan painter.

Wu Li	Question: question: Who did Wu learn poetry from?	Ref: ian Qianyi	Pred: Qian Qianyi	Context: Wu Li, SJ (simplified Chinese: 吴历; traditional Chinese: 吳歷; pinyin: Wú Lì); ca. 1632-1718 was a Chinese landscape painter, poet, calligrapher and Jesuit from Jiangsu who lived during the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912).Wu was born in Changzhou in the Jiangsu province of China. His style name was 'Yu Shan' and his sobriquet was 'Mojing Daoren'. Wu learned poetry from Qian Qianyi. He was taught painting by Wang Shimin and Wang Jian, and was influenced by the painters Huang Gongwang and Wang Meng. His landscapes utilized dry brush strokes and light colors. His distinctive style elevated him to where he is now identified as one of the Six Masters of the early Qing period.Wu converted to Catholicism, and became a member of the Society of Jesus.  In 1688, after seven years of training at St. Paul's College, Macau, he was ordained one of the three first Chinese Jesuit priests, taking the name Simon-Xavier a Cunha. He spent the remaining 30 years of his life serving tirelessly as priest in rural villages.The dramatic decline and fall of the Ming Dynasty and the coming to power of the Manchu Qing Dynasty caused the crisis of a number of intellectuals, who looked for new directions for them and for the country. The teaching of the Jesuits' learned missionaries, based out of Macau, appealed to them. Several literati, steeped in Confucianism and Buddhism, sought widening religious horizons, accepting the 'Western Teaching'. Conversion to Christianity was for them the arrival point of a spiritual and personal journey toward religious fulfillment. The converts saw in the Christian teaching an opportunity to revitalize, morally and scientifically, a country in crisis.Wu often went to the Xing Fu Buddhist convent in Suzhou during his middle-age years and was a close friend of monk Mo Yong, but from 1675 on he was inclined toward Catholicism through his contact with Jesuit missionaries Lu Rima (Franciscus de Rougemont), Bai Yingli (Phillippe Couplet), and others. He was converted and christened (by?) Ximan Sawulue (Simon Xaverius). In 1681 Couplet was recalled to Europe. Wu intended to go with him, but his plans did not materialize when they reached Macau. Wu remained in Macau for five months and returned to his hometown in the summer of 1682. He returned to Macau in the winter and joined the Society of Jesus.At the age of 50, Wu Li's life took a dramatic turn. After the death of his wife and his masters, obeying to an internal quest for spiritual excellence, fascinated by the Jesuit art and architecture, and after having been a Catholic for seven years, he chose to join the Jesuits in Macau in pursue of the 'heavenly learning'. There he strenuously searched 'the Western Lantern', struggling to learn a new language (Latin) and to acquire a new religious dimension, on the lines of the 'Spiritual Exercises', as a son of Saint Ignatius of Loyola.He was consecrated a priest on 1 Aug 1688 in Nanjing by Chinese bishop Luo Wenzao. His first pastoral assignment was in Shanghai. In 1691 he was put in charge of the religious affairs of the Jiading Catholic Church.Wu Li indeed chose for himself a path of self-denial and total dedication to the new faith and to the new ministry. Often disguised as a peasant or fisherman, he traveled for thirty years from village to village to evangelize. Wu Li could have become a rich and famous court painter, as had his friend Wang Hui, but he chose instead the obscurity of Jiangsu countryside to serve as an itinerant missionary and pastor, struggling against tremendous difficulties and with poor results. He was a good shepherd, in imitation of Christ, totally devoted to the spiritual welfare of peasants. The poems that he kept writing as a priest illustrate exceptional qualities of his tireless dedication, his faith, his joys and the moments of frustration.Wu Li in no way rejected his Chinese identity, as shown by the fact that his paintings maintained an autochthonous style, and he signed them with his Chinese name. The extent of Western influence in his figurative art, if any, has been discussed by scholars, with no clear consensus reached.Scholars, however, agree on the exceptionally important value of Wu Li's personal experience. Wu Li was a man of rare qualities: a fine Chinese intellectual, a remarkable artist, a Jesuit, a missionary and a priest totally devoted to his flock.Wu died at age 86 after serving 30 years as a priest. He composed many poems reflecting his own preaching career and religious feelings, which are collected in an anthology, San Yi Ji. His sermons from 15 Aug 1696 to 25 Dec 1697 and other religious activities were compiled by Zhao Lun, a convert in Jiading, in a book, Kou Duo (Record of Word and Deeds), the first collection of sermons by a Chinese priest.

He was one of the paragons of "scholar's painting" (shi ren hua), which idealised spontaneity and painting without financial reward.He could hold two brushes in one hand and paint two different distanced bamboos simultaneously. One Chinese idiom in relation to  him goes "there are whole bamboos in his heart" (胸有成竹), meaning that one has a well-thought-out plan in his mind.As did many artists of his era, Wen Tong also wrote poetry. As attested in his poems, he had  at least one golden-hair monkey (金丝狨) and a number of pet gibbons, whose graceful brachiation he admired. An elegy written by him upon the death of one of his gibbons has been preserved in the collection of his works.

He was also proficient in calligraphy. His works influenced later court painters, including Yu Sheng (余省), Yu Zhi (余稚).Although better known for his Gujin Tushu Jicheng, Jiang also contributed—along with other scholars—in the compilation of the "Daqing Yitongzhi" ('Gazetteer of the Qing Empire'). This geographical gazetteer was provided with a preface in 1744 (more than a decade after Jiang's death), revised in 1764, and reprinted in 1849.Apart of cultural activity, as a holder of the jinshi degree Tinxi performed the important duties in the Qing government's Office of Military Finance, on par with Zhang Tingyu (headed by Yinxiang, the Yongzheng Emperor's brother).

He was regarded as one of the Four Masters of Ming painting. Wen Zhengming was born Wen Bi near present-day Suzhou on 28 November 1470. He would later be known by his courtesy name, Zhengming. He had an elder brother, Wen Gui, who was born in 1469. When Zhengming was two years old, his father, Wen Lin, passed the imperial examination with the highest possible rank, jinshi. Wen Lin was assigned a government position as a magistrate in Yongjia County in Zhejiang province, and left for his job, leaving his two sons in the care of his wife, Qi Shenning. In 1476, Qi died of an illness at the age of 32. Wen Lin commissioned the noted scholar Li Dongyang to write an inscription for her tomb.Wen Zhengming's family was originally from a line of military men who lived in Hengshan County, Hunan province. At the time of his great-great-grandfather Wen Dingcong, the family moved to the city of Changzhou in the Suzhou area. Zhengming was a distant relative of the Song dynasty official Wen Tianxiang, through an ancestor who lived in Hengshan. From this he derived his hao (art name), Hengshan, which he used to sign many of his works. His father Wen Lin and his grandfather Wen Hong (Gongda) were both interested in painting. Wen Lin was also a patron of Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming's contemporary and fellow member of the "Four Masters of the Ming dynasty".In 1489, Wen Zhengming began studying under Shen Zhou, the eldest of the Four Masters and founder of the Wu school of painting, of which Wen himself later became a leading figure. Zhengming's father Wen Lin died in 1499, while working as prefect of Wenzhou. At Zhengming's request, Shen Zhou provided a written account of Wen Lin's life for the funeral.Wen Zhengming married the daughter of a high-ranking official and jinshi named Wu Yu around the year 1490. Her uncle was the artist Xia Chang, whose paintings of bamboo may have influenced Wen's own work. Little is known about Wen's wife herself, whose personal name was not recorded. After she died in 1542, Wen painted Wintry Trees after Li Cheng for a guest who arrived with a gift to mourn her death.Around 1509–1513, Wang Xianchen, a friend of the Wen family, began construction on the Humble Administrator's Garden, generally considered one of China's greatest classical gardens. The garden is the subject of some of Wen Zhengming's poems and paintings, including an album of thirty-one views painted in 1535 and a second of eight views in 1551.Wen Zhengming's brother Wen Gui died in 1536. Zhengming's eldest son, Wen Peng, was a noted seal-engraver. His second son. Wen Jia, was also an artist, as was his nephew Wen Boren (son of Wen Gui). His great grandson, Wen Zhenheng, a noted garden designer, rebuilt the Garden of Cultivation in Suzhou.

It emphasized on the importance of the unification of positive and negative space; dark and light shades. Each brush line is powerful and precise. The compact touches, the graceful outlines and the elegant styles of Xin’an School of painting (新安画派) had a profound influence on Huang throughout his life. His style before the age of sixty is called the White-period.After sixty years old, Huang went to Guichi. The scenery of Guichi not only attracted the artist, but also had a great impact on his style. Huang changed from focusing on brush and line to focusing on ink and wash. He started to practice the painting style of Wu Zhen. In 1928, Huang visited Guangxi and Guangdong and created a lot of works by sketching the real landscapes. Huang started to transit from his “White style” to “Black style”.At the age of sixty nine to seventy, Huang visited Sichuan. He was inspired by the atmosphere of Mount Qingcheng in rain and the Qutang Gorge under moonlight. He utilized dripping, staining and layers of dense ink to illustrate the misty wet feeling of rain and the nightly view of mountains.

After that, he moved to Hangzhou and started another new horizon in his art. Inspired by Western Impressionism, he integrated the two major Chinese painting systems (Ink and wash painting and color painting) into a unity. Dots of red, green and blue pigment merged with layers of dense ink creating a luxuriant and richly integrated style in which he deftly manipulated solid and void.  His varied style and creativity not only won him an honorary title, but also brought light into the modern Chinese art history.He also had significance for creating several societies devoted to painting and calligraphy.

Qigong	Question: question: What is a system of coordinated body-posture and movement called?	Ref: Qigong	Pred: Life energy cultivation	Context: Qigong (), qi gong, chi kung, chi 'ung, or chi gung (simplified Chinese: 气功; traditional Chinese: 氣功; pinyin: qìgōng; Wade–Giles: ch‘i kung; lit. 'life-energy cultivation') is a system of coordinated body-posture and movement, breathing, and meditation used for the purposes of health, spirituality, and martial-arts training. With roots in Chinese medicine, philosophy, and martial arts, qigong is traditionally viewed by the Chinese and throughout Asia as a practice to cultivate and balance qi (pronounced approximately as "chee"), translated as "life energy".Qigong practice typically involves moving meditation, coordinating slow-flowing movement, deep rhythmic breathing, and a calm meditative state of mind. People practice qigong throughout China and worldwide for recreation, exercise, relaxation, preventive medicine, self-healing, alternative medicine, meditation, self-cultivation, and training for martial arts.
Wu Guanzhong	Question: question: What language was Wu Guanzhong born in?	Ref: Chinese	Pred: Chinese	Context: Wu Guanzhong (simplified Chinese: 吴冠中; traditional Chinese: 吳冠中; pinyin: Wú Guànzhōng; 29 August 1919 – 25 June 2010) was a contemporary Chinese painter widely recognized as a founder of modern Chinese painting. He is considered to be one of the greatest contemporary Chinese painters. Wu's artworks display both Western and Eastern influences, such as the Western style of Fauvism and the Eastern style of Chinese calligraphy. Wu painted various aspects of China, including its architecture, plants, animals, people, as well as many of its landscapes and waterscapes, in a style reminiscent of the impressionist painters of the early 1900s. He was also a writer on contemporary Chinese art.
Luo Fu	Question: question: Who was Zhang Wentian's father?	Ref: Chang Wen-t'ien	Pred: Lee Fu	Context: Zhang Wentian (simplified Chinese: 张闻天; traditional Chinese: 張聞天; pinyin: Zhāng Wéntiān; Wade–Giles: Chang Wen-t'ien; 30 August 1900 – 1 July 1976), also known as Luo Fu (Chinese: 洛甫; Wade–Giles: Lo Fu), was a high-ranking leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).Born in Nanhui, he attended the Hohai Civil Engineering School in Nanjing and spent a year at the University of California. He later joined the CCP in 1925 and was sent to study at Sun Yat-sen University in Moscow, from 1926 to 1930. He was a member of the group known as the 28 Bolsheviks, but switched to supporting Mao Zedong during the Long March. He was General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party from 1935 to 1943, when the post was abolished.  He remained a member of the Politburo, but ranked 12th of 13 in the 7th Politburo and reduced to Alternate Member in the 8th Politburo.He was First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China from December 1954 to November 1960.  He was a participant of the Long March, and later served as an ambassador to the Soviet Union from April 1951 to January 1955.  At the Lushan Conference in 1959 he supported Peng Dehuai and lost power along with Peng. During the Cultural Revolution he was attacked as an ally of Peng and Liu Shaoqi; he was rehabilitated by Deng Xiaoping after Mao's death.
Jin Nong	Question: question: Where was Jin Nong born?	Ref: Hangzhou	Pred: Hangzhou	Context: Born in 1687 in Hangzhou, Jin Nong (金農) became popular as a painter and calligrapher while living as a childless widower in Yangzhou in his sixties. His paintings of mei blossoms were in particular demand there. Heralded as one of The Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou, Jin favored the amateur scholar style. A nonconformist, he generally painted more traditional images laden with symbolism (such as orchids, bamboo, chrysanthemums, and mei blossoms) and preserved his independence by selling works in an open market, rather than adopting an individual patron. Later styles included Buddhist imagery. However, Jin was the first artist in the Chinese tradition to paint a large number of self-portraits and did earn money through the patronage of wealthy individuals in Yangzhou who, in addition to buying works, were possible publishers for his numerous writings. Jin probably understood these contradictions as he argued that living off of painting should not be considered dishonorable.Jin Nong also made money as a writer and general entrepreneur. He was known to travel with a number of disciple-servants who assisted in the production of ink stones and lanterns to which he would add a personal artistic touch. It was through the sale of these items that Jin achieved financial independence; his single, failed attempt to compete for office was in the year 1736. He became widely known for his writings, but when his health began to fail, painting became his principal source of income and he in fact acknowledged the use of ghost-painters as a way to increase production. One such understudy, Luo Ping (whose name is sometimes rendered "Lo Ping"), also edited some compilations of his works. He continued to write throughout this time and was a critic as well as a dealer of paintings. There is some confusion about Jin's year of death, but it was most likely 1763 or 1764.He also had a reputation as a calligrapher creating a style he called "lacquer calligraphy."

Hanabusa Itchō	Question: question: What style did Hanabusa Itch first train in?	Ref: Kanō	Pred: Kan style	Context: Hanabusa Itchō (英 一蝶, 1652 – February 7, 1724) was a Japanese painter, calligrapher, and haiku poet. He originally trained in the Kanō style, under Kanō Yasunobu, but ultimately rejected that style and became a literati (bunjin). He was also known as Hishikawa Waō and by a number of other art-names.
Utagawa Hiroshige	Question: question: Who was considered the last great master of ukiyo-e?	Ref: Hiroshige	Pred: Utagawa Hiroshige	Context: Utagawa Hiroshige (, also US: ; Japanese: 歌川 広重 [ɯtaɡawa çiɾoꜜɕiɡe]), born Andō Tokutarō (安藤 徳太郎; 1797 – 12 October 1858), was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist, considered the last great master of that tradition.Hiroshige is best known for his horizontal-format landscape series The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō and for his vertical-format landscape series One Hundred Famous Views of Edo.  The subjects of his work were atypical of the ukiyo-e genre, whose typical focus was on beautiful women, popular actors, and other scenes of the urban pleasure districts of Japan's Edo period (1603–1868).  The popular series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji by Hokusai was a strong influence on Hiroshige's choice of subject, though Hiroshige's approach was more poetic and ambient than Hokusai's bolder, more formal prints. Subtle use of color was essential in Hiroshige's prints, often printed with multiple impressions in the same area and with extensive use of bokashi (color gradation), both of which were rather labor-intensive techniques.For scholars and collectors, Hiroshige's death marked the beginning of a rapid decline in the ukiyo-e genre, especially in the face of the westernization that followed the Meiji Restoration of 1868. Hiroshige's work came to have a marked influence on western European painting towards the close of the 19th century as a part of the trend in Japonism. Western European artists, such as Manet and Monet, collected and closely studied Hiroshige's compositions. Vincent van Gogh even went so far as to paint copies of two of Hiroshige's prints from One Hundred Famous Views of Edo: Plum Park in Kameido and Sudden Shower over Shin-Ōhashi bridge and Atake
Katsukawa Shunshō	Question: question: Who was Shunsh's father?	Ref: Miyagawa Chōshun	Pred: Miyagawa Shunsui	Context: Shunshō Katsukawa  (Japanese: 勝川 春章; 1726 – 19 January 1793) was a Japanese painter and printmaker in the ukiyo-e style, and the leading artist of the Katsukawa school. Shunshō studied under Miyagawa Shunsui, son and student of Miyagawa Chōshun, both equally famous and talented ukiyo-e artists. Shunshō is most well known for introducing a new form of yakusha-e, prints depicting Kabuki actors. However, his bijin-ga (images of beautiful women) paintings, while less famous, are said by some scholars to be "the best in the second half of the [18th] century".
Katsukawa Shun'ei	Question: question: Who was the head of the Katsukawa school of artists?	Ref: Shun'ei	Pred: Shunsen	Context: Katsukawa Shun'ei (Japanese: 勝川 春英; 1762 – 13 December 1819) was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist.Shun'ei's real surname was Isoda (磯田), and his father was a landlord named Isoda Jirōbei (磯田 次郎兵衛).Shun'ei belonged to the Katsukawa school of artists; his earliest work dates to 1778.  He designed mainly yakusha-e portraits of kabuki actors, and began producing ōkubi-e bust portraits as early as 1791. Together with Toyokuni I he illustrated the five-volume kabuki guide called Shibai kinmō zue ("Illustrated Guide to the Theatre") by Shikitei Sanba.  He also made musha-e warrior prints and prints of sumo wrestlers.  In c. 1800 he took over as head from his teacher, Shunshō.  His most prominent students were Katsukawa Shuntei and Katsukawa Shunsen.  Shun'ei and several other artists, including Utamaro and Toyokuni, were jailed and manacled for 50 days in 1804 for producing prints depicting Toyotomi Hideyoshi based on the Ehon taikōki ("Illustrated Chronicles of the Regent").Prints by Shun'ei
Katsukawa Shunkō I	Question: question: What nationality was Katsukawa Shunka I?	Ref: Japanese	Pred: Japanese	Context: Katsukawa Shunkō I (Japanese: 勝川 春好; 1743 – 1 December 1812) was a Japanese artist who designed ukiyo-e-style woodblock prints and paintings in Edo (modern Tokyo).  He was a student of Katsukawa Shunshō, and is generally credited with designing the first large-head actor portraits (ōkubi-e).  As his teacher did, Shunkō used a jar-shaped seal and was known as kotsubo ("little jar").  At 45, the right-handed Shunkō became partially paralyzed and ceased designing prints, although he continued producing paintings with his left hand.
Chōbunsai Eishi	Question: question: Who was a vassal of the Shogunate?	Ref: Eishi	Pred: Eishi	Context: Chōbunsai Eishi (鳥文斎 栄之, 1756–1829) was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist. His last name was Hosoda (細田). His first name was Tokitomi (時富). His common name was Taminosuke (民之丞) and later Yasaburo (弥三郎). Pupil of Kano Eisen'in Michinobu (狩野 栄川院 典信). Born as the first son of direct vassal of the Shogunate, a well-off samurai family that was part of the Fujiwara clan. Eishi was a vassal of the Shogunate with a generous stipend of 500 'koku' (90,000 litres) of rice. Eishi left his employ with the Shōgun Ieharu to pursue art.  His early works were prints, mostly Bijin-ga portraits of tall, thin, graceful beauties in the original style established by himself akin to Kiyonaga and Utamaro. He established his own school and was a rival to Utamaro.  He was a prolific painter, and from 1801 gave up print designing to devote himself to painting.
Katsushika Hokusai	Question: question: What mountain did Hokusai create as a response to a domestic travel boom?	Ref: Mount Fuji	Pred: Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji	Context: Katsushika Hokusai (葛飾 北斎, c. 31 October 1760 – 10 May 1849), known simply as Hokusai, was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist of the Edo period, active as a painter and printmaker. He is best known for the woodblock print series Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji, which includes the iconic print The Great Wave off Kanagawa. Hokusai was instrumental in developing ukiyo-e from a style of portraiture largely focused on courtesans and actors into a much broader style of art that focused on landscapes, plants, and animals. His works are thought to have had a significant influence on Vincent van Gogh and Claude Monet during the wave of Japonisme, that spread across Europe in the late 19th century.Hokusai created the monumental Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji as a response to a domestic travel boom in Japan and as part of a personal interest in Mount Fuji. It was this series, specifically, The Great Wave off Kanagawa and Fine Wind, Clear Morning, that secured his fame both in Japan and overseas.Hokusai was best known for his woodblock ukiyo-e prints, but he worked in a variety of mediums including painting and book illustration. Starting as a young child, he continued working and improving his style until his death, aged 88. In a long and successful career, Hokusai produced over 30,000 paintings, sketches, woodblock prints, and images for picture books in total. Innovative in his compositions and exceptional in his drawing technique, Hokusai is considered one of the greatest masters in the history of art.
Torii Kiyonaga	Question: question: Where was Sekiguchi Shinsuke from?	Ref: Motozaimokuchō Itchōme	Pred: Motozaimokuch Itchme in Edo	Context: Torii Kiyonaga (Japanese: 鳥居 清長; 1752 – June 28, 1815) was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist of the Torii school. Originally Sekiguchi Shinsuke, the son of an Edo bookseller, from Motozaimokuchō Itchōme in Edo, he took on Torii Kiyonaga as an art name. Although not biologically related to the Torii family, he became head of the group after the death of his adoptive father and teacher Torii Kiyomitsu.The master Kiyomitsu died in 1785; since his son died young, and Kiyotsune, Kiyonaga's senior, was a less promising artist, Kiyonaga was the obvious choice to succeed Kiyomitsu to leadership of the Torii school. However, he delayed this for two years, likely devoting time to his bijin-ga and realizing the immense responsibility that would fall on his shoulders once he took over the school. Thus, in 1787, he began organizing the production of kabuki signboards and the like, which the school held a near monopoly on. He also began to train Kiyomitsu's grandson, Torii Kiyomine, who was to succeed him.
Isoda Koryūsai	Question: question: Who was a Japanese ukiyo-e print designer and painter?	Ref: Isoda Koryūsai	Pred: Isoda Korysai	Context: Isoda Koryūsai (礒田 湖龍斎, 1735–1790) was a Japanese ukiyo-e print designer and painter active from 1769 to 1790. Koryūsai was born in 1735 and worked as a samurai in the service of the Tsuchiya clan.  He became a masterless rōnin after the death of the head of the clan and moved to Edo (modern Tokyo) where he settled near Ryōgoku Bridge in the Yagenbori area.  He became a print designer there under the art name Haruhiro in 1769, at first making samurai-themed designs.  The ukiyo-e print master Harunobu died in 1770, and about that time Koryūsai began making prints in a similar style of life in the pleasure districts.Koryūsai was a prolific designer of individual prints and print series, most of which appeared between 1769 and 1881.In 1782 Koryūsai applied for and received the Buddhist honour hokkyō ("Bridge of the Law") from the imperial court and thereafter used the title as part of his signature.  His output slowed from this time, though he continued to design prints until his death in 1790.
Kitagawa Utamaro	Question: question: Who was one of the few ukiyo-e artists to achieve fame throughout Japan in his lifetime?	Ref: Utamaro	Pred: Utamaro	Context: Kitagawa Utamaro (Japanese: 喜多川 歌麿; c. 1753 – 31 October 1806) was a Japanese artist.  He is one of the most highly regarded designers of ukiyo-e woodblock prints and paintings, and is best known for his bijin ōkubi-e "large-headed pictures of beautiful women" of the 1790s.  He also produced nature studies, particularly illustrated books of insects.Little is known of Utamaro's life.  His work began to appear in the 1770s, and he rose to prominence in the early 1790s with his portraits of beauties with exaggerated, elongated features.  He produced over 2000 known prints and was one of the few ukiyo-e artists to achieve fame throughout Japan in his lifetime.  In 1804 he was arrested and manacled for fifty days for making illegal prints depicting the 16th-century military ruler Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and died two years later.Utamaro's work reached Europe in the mid-nineteenth century, where it was very popular, enjoying particular acclaim in France. He influenced the European Impressionists, particularly with his use of partial views and his emphasis on light and shade, which they imitated. The reference to the "Japanese influence" among these artists often refers to the work of Utamaro.
Suzuki Harunobu	Question: question: Who was a famous artist who imitated Harunobu's style?	Ref: Harushige	Pred: Harushige	Context: Suzuki Harunobu (Japanese: 鈴木 春信; c. 1725 – 8 July 1770) was a Japanese designer of woodblock print art in the ukiyo-e style. He was an innovator, the first to produce full-color prints (nishiki-e) in 1765, rendering obsolete the former modes of two- and three-color prints. Harunobu used many special techniques, and depicted a wide variety of subjects, from classical poems to contemporary beauties. Like many artists of his day, Harunobu also produced a number of shunga, or erotic images. During his lifetime and shortly afterwards, many artists imitated his style. A few, such as Harushige, even boasted of their ability to forge the work of the great master. Much about Harunobu's life is unknown.
Katsukawa Shunchō	Question: question: What is the name of the collection that houses Shunch's work?	Ref: Hyde Collection	Pred: The Hyde Collection	Context: Katsukawa Shunchō (勝川 春潮) was a Japanese designer of ukiyo-e style Japanese woodblock prints, who was active from about 1783 to about 1795.Although a student of Katsukawa Shunshō, Shunchō's output, which consists mostly of prints of beautiful women, more closely resembles the work of Torii Kiyonaga.Shunchō also designed many shunga prints, which also resemble those of Torii Kiyonaga.His work is held in the permanent collections of many museums worldwide, including the British Museum, the Portland Art Museum, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, the Reading Public Museum, the Gregory Allicar Museum of Art, the Harvard Art Museums, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Mead Art Museum at Amherst College, the Hyde Collection, the MOA Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Suntory Museum of Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Kubo Shunman	Question: question: Who was the most prolific producer of paintings in the Kitao school?	Ref: Kubo Shunman	Pred: Shunman	Context: Kubo Shunman (Japanese: 窪 俊満; c. 1757 – 26 October 1820) was a Japanese artist and writer.  He produced ukiyo-e prints and paintings, gesaku novels, and kyōka and haiku poetry. Shunman was born in about 1757 (Hōreki 7 on the Japanese calendar) with the surname of either Kubo (窪) or Kubota (窪田) and the given name Yasubei (易兵衛 or 安兵衛).  He was orphaned while young.  He studied under Katori Nahiko, a poet, kokugaku scholar, and painter in the style of the Chinese Shen Quan.  He later also studied under the ukiyo-e artist Kitao Shigemasa.Upon finishing his apprenticeship took the art name Shunman (first spelt 春満, later 俊満).  Other art names he used include Shōsadō (尚左堂) and Sashōdō (左尚堂), both of which use the character 左 sa, meaning "left", as he was left-handed.  Early in his career he published as a gesaku novelist under the names Nandaka Shiran (南陀伽 紫蘭) and Kizandō (黄山堂), as a kyōka poet under the name Hitofushi Chitsue (一節 千杖), and as a haiku poet under the name (塩辛房).  He had a heightened sense of beauty and devoted himself to the pleasure-seeking world.Shunman's earliest works dates to 1774: a votive plaque copied from Nahiko.  His works include some ukiyo-e prints, book illustrations, paintings, illustrated novels, and poetry.  He was the most prolific producer of paintings in the Kitao school; more than 70 of his paintings survive.His best known prints come from the Tenmei (1781–1789) through the Kansei (1789–1801) eras, when Shunman tended toward boldly florid colours in his prints, and adhered to the beni-girai ("red-hating") trend of avoiding reds and other flashy colours.  His bijin-ga portraits of beauties were less in the stately style of his master Shigemasa than in that of the long, slender beauties of Torii Kiyonaga.Shunman was a member of the poets' clubs Bakuro-ren and Rokujuen, and became head of Bakuro-ren.  He stopped making designing commercial prints in 1790 to focus on deluxe commissioned prints, and provided poetry for the prints of Hokusai, Utamaro, and Eishi.Prints by Shunman
Okumura Masanobu	Question: question: What was Masanobu's nationality?	Ref: Japanese	Pred: Japanese	Context: Okumura Masanobu (Japanese: 奥村 政信; 1686 – 13 March 1764) was a Japanese print designer, book publisher, and painter. He also illustrated novelettes and in his early years wrote some fiction. At first his work adhered to the Torii school, but later drifted beyond that. He is a figure in the formative era of ukiyo-e doing early works on actors and bijin-ga ("pictures of beautiful women").
Eishōsai Chōki	Question: question: What is the most famous of Eishsai's works?	Ref: Chōki	Pred: Shik	Context: Eishōsai Chōki (Japanese: 栄松斎 長喜), also known as Momokawa Chōki, was a designer of ukiyo-e style Japanese woodblock prints who was active from about 1786 to 1808.  He, along with Utamaro, was a pupil of Toriyama Sekien (1712–1788).  Chōki is best known for his pictures of beautiful slender women (bijin-ga), often with atmospheric backgrounds.The artist signed most of his works Chōki (長喜), he also signed some work Eishōsai (栄松斎) or Shikō (子興).
Utagawa Toyoharu	Question: question: Who was the founder of the Utagawa school?	Ref: Toyoharu	Pred: Utagawa Toyoharu	Context: Utagawa Toyoharu (歌川 豊春, c. 1735 – 1814) was a Japanese artist in the ukiyo-e genre, known as the founder of the Utagawa school and for his uki-e pictures that incorporated Western-style geometrical perspective to create a sense of depth.Born in Toyooka in Tajima Province, Toyoharu first studied art in Kyoto, then in Edo (modern Tokyo), where from 1768 he began to produce designs for ukiyo-e woodblock prints. He soon became known for his uki-e "floating pictures" of landscapes and famous sites, as well as copies of Western and Chinese perspective prints. Though his were not the first perspective prints in ukiyo-e, they were the first to appear as full-colour nishiki-e, and they demonstrate a much greater mastery of perspective techniques than the works of his predecessors.  Toyoharu was the first to make the landscape a subject of ukiyo-e art, rather than just a background to figures and events.  By the 1780s he had turned primarily to painting.  The Utagawa school of art grew to dominate ukiyo-e in the 19th century with artists such as Utamaro, Hiroshige, and Kuniyoshi.
Kitao Shigemasa	Question: question: Where was Kitao Shigemasa from?	Ref: Edo	Pred: Edo	Context: Kitao Shigemasa (北尾 重政, 1739 – 8 March 1820) was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist from Edo. He was one of the leading printmakers of his day, but his works have been slightly obscure. He is noted for images of beautiful women (bijinga). He was taught by Shigenaga and has been referred to as "a chameleon" who adopted to changing styles. He was less active after the rise of Torii Kiyonaga and produced relatively few works considering the length of his career. He is also noted for his haikai (poetry) and shodō (Japanese calligraphy). In his later years he used the studio name Kosuisai.
Sharaku	Question: question: What nationality was Tshasai Sharaku?	Ref: Japanese	Pred: Japanese	Context: Tōshūsai Sharaku (Japanese: 東洲斎 写楽; active 1794–1795) was a Japanese ukiyo-e print designer, known for his portraits of kabuki actors.  Neither his true name nor the dates of his birth or death are known.  His active career as a woodblock artist spanned ten months; his prolific work met disapproval and his output came to an end as suddenly and mysteriously as it had begun.  His work has come to be considered some of the greatest in the ukiyo-e genre.Sharaku made mostly yakusha-e portraits of kabuki actors.  His compositions emphasize poses of dynamism and energy, and display a realism unusual for prints of the time—contemporaries such as Utamaro represented their subjects with an idealized beauty, while Sharaku did not shy from showing unflattering details.  This was not to the tastes of the public, and the enigmatic artist's production ceased in the first month of 1795.  His mastery of the medium with no apparent apprenticeship has drawn much speculation, and researchers have long tried to discover his true identity—amongst the dozens of proposals, some suggest he was an obscure poet, others a Noh actor, or even the ukiyo-e master Hokusai.
Torii Kiyomasu	Question: question: Which Torii artist was more graceful than Kiyomasu?	Ref: Kiyonobu	Pred: His style	Context: Torii Kiyomasu (鳥居 清倍, fl. 1690s – 1720s) was a Japanese painter and printmaker of the Torii school, in the genre of ukiyo-e. Like the other Torii artists, his primary focus was on Kabuki billboards, advertisements, actor prints, and other related material. Many scholars believe Kiyomasu to have been the younger brother or son of Torii Kiyonobu I, one of the founders of the school, or to have been an alternate art-name (gō) for the same man.In the 1710s, prints signed with Kiyomasu's name far outnumber those with the signature of Kiyonobu. If the two were distinct artists, this could indicate that the elder artist, the head of the school, devoted more time to the kabuki billboards and other works which were more the official province of the workshop, while the younger was left to do prints. On the other hand, even if the two were the same person, this could simply be explained by the use of different names on different types of work.Though his style is said to be somewhat more graceful than Kiyonobu's, they are difficult to tell apart, as are most works by other Torii artists. However, there are certain stylistic elements that do stand out as differences between the two artists. While Kiyonobu's work was based largely on that of Hishikawa Moronobu, and was very masculine in nature, with sharp, bold lines, Kiyomasu's works, while very similar at first glance, are in fact softer and more graceful; they are said to show a "lack of seriousness of intent". This shift is attributed to an emulation of the styles of Moronobu's chief competitor, Sugimura Jihei.
Torii Kiyomitsu	Question: question: Whose work did Kiyomitsu rival?	Ref: Suzuki Harunobu	Pred: Suzuki Harunobu	Context: Torii Kiyomitsu (鳥居 清満, 1735 – May 11, 1785) was a painter and printmaker of the Torii school of Japanese ukiyo-e art; the son of Torii Kiyonobu II or Torii Kiyomasu II, he was the third head of the school, and was originally called Kamejirō before taking the gō Kiyomitsu. Dividing his work between actor prints and bijinga (pictures of beautiful women), he primarily used the benizuri-e technique prolific at the time, which involved using one or two colors of ink on the woodblocks rather than hand-coloring; full-color prints would be introduced later in Kiyomitsu's career, in 1765.Though scholars generally note his kabuki prints as lacking originality, they see a grace, beauty, and "dream-like quality" in his prints of young men and women which, at times, rivals that of the work of Suzuki Harunobu, who was just beginning his career at this time. Kiyomitsu continued to produce the billboards and other kabuki-related materials which were the domain of the Torii school, and in those works he was quite traditional and retrospective in his style. However, he was more or less the first Torii artist to experiment outside that field, and to truly emerge into the wider mainstream of ukiyo-e styles, adapting to the use of new techniques and popular subjects. Overall, it is said that the workshop flourished under his direction, but the core "Torii style" was not truly changed or advanced.Two of his greatest pupils were Torii Kiyotsune, who faithfully continued the Torii traditions, and Torii Kiyonaga, who went on to be a master and innovator in his own right.
Utagawa Toyokuni I	Question: question: What was Toyokuni's nationality?	Ref: Japanes	Pred: Japanese	Context: Utagawa Toyokuni (Japanese: 歌川豊国; 1769 in Edo – 24 February 1825 in Edo), also often referred to as Toyokuni I, to distinguish him from the members of his school who took over his gō (art-name) after he died, was a great master of ukiyo-e, known in particular for his kabuki actor prints. He was the second head of the renowned Utagawa school of Japanese woodblock artists, and was the artist who elevated it to the position of great fame and power it occupied for the rest of the nineteenth century.
Utagawa Kunisada	Question: question: What is another name for Utagawa Kunisada?	Ref: Utagawa Toyokuni III	Pred: Utagawa Toyokuni III	Context: Utagawa Kunisada (Japanese: 歌川 国貞; 1786 – 12 January 1865), also known as Utagawa Toyokuni III (三代 歌川 豊国, Sandai Utagawa Toyokuni), was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist. He is considered the most popular, prolific and commercially successful designer of ukiyo-e woodblock prints in 19th-century Japan. In his own time, his reputation far exceeded that of his contemporaries, Hokusai, Hiroshige and Kuniyoshi.
Utagawa Kuniyoshi	Question: question: What school was Kuniyoshi a member of?	Ref: Utagawa	Pred: Utagawa	Context: Utagawa Kuniyoshi (Japanese: 歌川 国芳, [ɯtaɡawa kɯɲiꜜjoɕi]; January 1, 1798 – April 14, 1861) was one of the last great masters of the Japanese ukiyo-e style of woodblock prints and painting. He was a member of the Utagawa school.The range of Kuniyoshi's subjects included many genres: landscapes, beautiful women, Kabuki actors, cats, and mythical animals.  He is known for depictions of the battles of legendary samurai heroes. His artwork incorporated aspects of Western representation in landscape painting and caricature.
Keisai Eisen	Question: question: What was Keisai Eisen's other name?	Ref: Ikeda Eisen	Pred: Ikeda Eisen	Context: Keisai Eisen (渓斎 英泉, 1790–1848) was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist who specialised in bijin-ga (pictures of beautiful women). His best works, including his ōkubi-e ("large head pictures"), are considered to be masterpieces of the "decadent" Bunsei Era (1818–1830). He was also known as Ikeda Eisen, and wrote under the name of Ippitsuan.
Utagawa Toyokuni II	Question: question: What was the name of Utagawa Toyokuni II?	Ref: Toyoshige's	Pred: Toyoshige	Context: Utagawa Toyokuni II (1777–1835), also known as Toyoshige, was a designer of ukiyo-e Japanese woodblock prints in Edo.  He was the pupil, son-in-law and adopted son of Toyokuni I.  The former used the name Toyoshige (豊重) until 1826, the year after his teacher's death, when the family gave him the right to use his teacher's name and he began signing his work Toyokuni (豊国). In 1835 he died, and in 1844 the family persuaded Kunisada, the most famous student of Toyokuni I, to use the name "Toyokuni" and become leader of the school. Although Kunisada never recognised Toyoshige's right to the name Toyokuni, nevertheless Kunisada after 1844 is always referred to as Toyokuni III.Toyokuni I, Toyokuni II (Toyoshige), and Toyokuni III (Kunisada) each used the signature Toyokuni (豊国).  The signature of Toyokuni II is easiest to distinguish by the chalice-shaped toyo (豊) kanji (see figure). Toyoshige's students include Utagawa Kunimatsu, Utagawa Kunishige II, Utagawa Kuniteru III, and Utagawa Kunitsuru I.
Kobayashi Kiyochika	Question: question: Who was the last significant example of ukiyo-e?	Ref: Kobayashi Kiyochika	Pred: Kobayashi's work	Context: Kobayashi Kiyochika (小林 清親, 10 September 1847 – 28 November 1915) was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist, best known for his colour woodblock prints and newspaper illustrations.  His work documents the rapid modernization and Westernization Japan underwent during the Meiji period (1868–1912) and employs a sense of light and shade called kōsen-ga inspired by Western art techniques.  His work first found an audience in the 1870s with prints of red-brick buildings and trains that had proliferated after the Meiji Restoration; his prints of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95 were also popular.  Woodblock printing fell out of favour during this period, and many collectors consider Kobayashi's work the last significant example of ukiyo-e.
Hishikawa Moronobu	Question: question: What genre of art did Hishikawa Moronobu create?	Ref: ese	Pred: Ukiyo-e	Context: Hishikawa Moronobu (Japanese: 菱川 師宣; 1618 – 25 July 1694) was a Japanese artist known for popularizing the ukiyo-e genre of woodblock prints and paintings in the late 17th century. He consolidated the works of scattered Japanese art styles and forged the early development of ukiyo-e.
Torii Kiyohiro	Question: question: Where did Kiyohiro live?	Ref: Sakaimachi area	Pred: Sakaimachi area of Edo	Context: Torii Kiyohiro (鳥居 清広, d. c. 1776) was a Japanese artist of the Torii school of ukiyo-e.Kiyohiro's date of birth is unknown, while Ukiyo-e Ruikō lists his death date as 1776. No other evidence of those dates are known.Kiyohiro's personal name was Shichinosuke (七之助).  He lived in the Sakaimachi area of Edo (modern Tokyo) and was registered as a student of Torii Kiyomasu I and likely studied under Torii Kiyonobu II or Torii Kiyomasu II. Ernest Fenollosa considered him "of almost equal ability with" his contemporary Torii Kiyomitsu, and speculated they may have been brothers.Kiyohiro's first known work appeared about 1751, and the last about 1764. All of his known works are benizuri-e, and though the Torii school was known for its yakusha-e actor prints, Kiyohiro also specialized in bijin-ga prints of female beauties extending into some with erotic themes. He specialized in designing prints in the ōban size. Two of his major sponsors/printers were Sakai-ya of Hongoku-chō, and Hōsendō of Tōri Abura-chō, both in the close neighborhood of Ichimura and Nakamura kabuki theaters.Works by Torii Kiyohiro
Utagawa Hiroshige II	Question: question: What was Hiroshige II's full name?	Ref: Ni-daime Utagawa Hiroshige	Pred: Kisai Rissh	Context: Hiroshige II (二代目 歌川広重, Ni-daime Utagawa Hiroshige, 1826 – 17 September 1869) was a Japanese designer of ukiyo-e art.  He inherited the name Hiroshige II following the death in 1858 of his master Hiroshige, whose daughter he married.  In 1865 he moved from Edo to Yokohama after dissolving his marriage and began using the name Kisai Risshō (喜斎立祥; alternate pronunciation: Ryūshō).  His work so resembles that of his master that scholars have often confused them.
Torii Kiyonobu	Question: question: Who was Kiyonobu's father?	Ref: you	Pred: Hishikawa Moronobu	Context: Torii Kiyonobu I (Japanese: 鳥居 清信; c. 1664 – 22 August 1729) was a Japanese painter and printmaker in the ukiyo-e style, who is renowned for his work on kabuki signboards and related materials. Along with his father Torii Kiyomoto, he is said to have been one of the founders of the Torii school of painting.Known in childhood as Shōbei, young Kiyonobu was the second son of the established Osaka kabuki actor and painter Torii Kiyomoto, born in 1664. He moved, with his father, to Edo (modern Tokyo) when he was twenty-four, and emerged there as a major artist with a unique style. Kiyonobu's work is regarded as being highly influenced by that of Hishikawa Moronobu (d. 1694), the father of ukiyo-e; Kiyonobu would also have been well-versed, as most major artists were at the time, in the styles of the Kanō and Tosa schools.Kiyonobu focused almost exclusively on producing billboards and other promotional material for Edo's kabuki theaters; the relationship between the theaters and the Torii school was a strong and important one, and one that continues today. Guided by the need to attract attention, Kiyonobu's style tended towards bold, colorful exuberance. In addition to a distinctive use of color, details, and various other aesthetic elements, the Torii style is especially distinguished by the use of thick, bold line.By 1700, Kiyonobu was a fully established and accomplished artist. His works were praised by contemporary writers, and were often even placed in Shintō shrines as votive offerings, a fact which indicates something of the artistic quality or emotional impact of his depictions of Kabuki actors. By the time of his death in 1729, Kiyonobu had not only painted a great number of signboards and the like, but had also produced illustrations for woodblock printed books, depicting kabuki dramas, and had issued individual prints as well.As is the case with most Torii school artists, Kiyonobu's dates are not known for sure, and the relationships between the various Torii artists are similarly unclear. The styles of Kiyonobu's disciples and relatives are very similar, and most scholars entertain the possibility that Kiyonobu II or Kiyomasu I were the same man as the subject of this article, Kiyonobu I, or as one another. Very few, if any, paintings created by the Torii school are known definitely to have been painted by any one particular artist.
Furuyama Moromasa	Question: question: Who was Furuyama Moromasa's father?	Ref: Furuyama Moroshige	Pred: Hishikawa Moronobu	Context: Furuyama Moromasa (Japanese: 古山師政, act. ca. 1695-1748) was a Japanese ukiyo-e painter and print artist, active during the 18th century. Few details of his life have survived. He was born in Edo (Tokyo), the son of the artist Furuyama Moroshige, who in turn was the son of the master artist Hishikawa Moronobu but established his own lineage, the Furuyama School.Moromasa designed woodblock prints with genre scenes of ordinary life, sporting contests, activities in the Yoshiwara district and similar subjects. He was one of the first Japanese artists to use linear perspective, a technique first used to show interiors, such as tea houses, in a genre known as uki-e. This was likely done under the influence of megane-e (vedute) from Europe and China. He also produced paintings in the popular category of 'beautiful women' (bijin-ga).Moromasa's most famous work is a pair of handscroll paintings depicting the theater district (Azuma yarō; owned by Central Library, Edinburgh) and brothel district (Shinobu-yama; owned by Museo Stibbert, Florence) of Edo, measuring 13 meters and 16 meters long respectively.He was active until around the mid-1700s and wrote several texts on the subject of engraving.
Ishikawa Toyonobu	Question: question: Who was a notable ukiyo-e print artist?	Ref: Ishikawa Toyonobu	Pred: Ishikawa Toyobu	Context: Ishikawa Toyonobu (石川 豊信, 1711 – July 1, 1785) was a Japanese ukiyo-e print artist. He is sometimes said to have been the same person as Nishimura Shigenobu, a contemporary ukiyo-e artist and student of Nishimura Shigenaga about whom very little is known.A pupil of Nishimura Shigenaga, Toyonobu produced many monochrome "lacquer prints" (urushi-e) which reflected the influence of Okumura Masanobu as well. Many of these were yakusha-e (actor prints) and bijin-ga (images of beautiful women), including images of standing courtesans, whose faces conveyed an impassivity typical of the works of the Kaigetsudō school.Toyonobu also experimented with semi-nude forms, something his chief predecessors also did, but never succeeded in developing it into a trend or subgenre within ukiyo-e. Art historian Richard Lane points out that these images, depicting women with the top half of their kimono open and let down to reveal their chests, were intended as suggestive and erotic, and were not "glorification of the human form such as we find in Greek art".Later in his career, Toyonobu became one of the leading producers of color prints, chiefly benizuri-e ("rose prints"), but stopped producing ukiyo-e shortly after Suzuki Harunobu pioneered the full-color print (nishiki-e) in 1765.He had one notable pupil, Ishikawa Toyomasa, who is known chiefly for his depictions of children at play, and who may have been Toyonobu's son.
Nishimura Shigenaga	Question: question: Where was Nishimura Shigenaga born?	Ref: Edo	Pred: Edo	Context: Nishimura Shigenaga (Japanese: 西村 重長; c. 1697 – 23 July 1756) was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist.Shigenaga was born c. 1697 in Edo (modern Tokyo).  He worked as a landlord in Tōriabura-chō before moving to the Kanda district, where he ran a bookshop and taught himself art; he is not known to have had a teacher.  His work began to appear c. 1719.  He worked in a variety of genres and formats.  His earlier work tended to be yakusha-e portraits of kabuki actors in the style of the Torii school; his later work is in an idiom more his own, incorporating the influence of Okumura Masanobu and Nishikawa Sukenobu.  Other genres he worked in include landscapes, kachō-e pictures of scenes of nature, and historical scenes.  He made a number of uki-e "floating pictures" incorporating geometric perspective.  The number of uki-e he produced was second only to Masanobu, who asserted himself the originator of the technique.Shigenaga's better-known work includes the series Fifty-four Sheets of Genji, a collaborative series with Torii Kiyomasu II in c. 1730–35; and the Picture Book of Edo Souvenirs in 1753.  He produced some of the earliest ukiyo-e landscape prints; in 1727, his was the first set of prints of Lake Biwa.  His work had a strong influence on later artists such as Suzuki Harunobu and Ishikawa Toyonobu, who may have been students of Shigenaga's; Toyonobu may have been Nishimura Shigenobu, Shigenaga's most prominent student.Prints by Shigenaga
Nishikawa Sukenobu	Question: question: Who was a printmaker from Kyoto?	Ref: Nishikawa Sukenobu	Pred: Nishikawa Sukenobu	Context: Nishikawa Sukenobu (西川 祐信, 1671 – August 20, 1750), often called simply "Sukenobu", was a Japanese printmaker from Kyoto. He was unusual for an ukiyo-e artist, as he was based in the imperial capital of Kyoto. He did prints of actors, but gained note for his works concerning women. His Hyakunin joro shinasadame (Appreciating 100 women), in two volumes published in 1723, depicted women of all classes, from the empress to prostitutes, and received favorable results.
Okumura Toshinobu	Question: question: From what era did most of Toshinobu's work come?	Ref: Genbun	Pred: Genbun	Context: Okumura Toshinobu (奥村 利信, birth and death dates unknown) was a Japanese ukiyo-e artist.  He is the only known student of Okumura Masanobu; many of his works nonetheless appeared from publishers other than Masanobu.The majority of Toshinobu's works come from the Genbun era (1716–1741), and are mostly prints in the beni-e ("red picture[s]") and urushi-e ("lacquer picture[s]") styles.  Many of his works depict people selling things.  Toshinobu also made yakusha-e portraits of kabuki actors; in contrast to the Torii school, rather than heroics, Toshionobu tended to depict scenes of romance.
Utagawa Sadahide	Question: question: What style of prints did Utagawa Sadahide create?	Ref: e	Pred: ukiyo-e	Context: Utagawa Sadahide (歌川 貞秀, 1807 – c. 1878–1879), also known as Gountei Sadahide (五雲亭 貞秀), was a Japanese artist best known for his prints in the ukiyo-e style as a member of the Utagawa school.  His prints covered a wide variety of genres; amongst his best known are his Yokohama-e pictures of foreigners in Yokohama in the 1860s, a period when he was a best-selling artist.  He was a member of the Tokugawa shogunate's delegation to the International Exposition of 1867 in Paris.
Manohar Das	Question: question: What was the name of the Indian Hindu painter?	Ref: Manohar	Pred: Manohar Das	Context: Manohar Das, also Manohar or Manuhar, (active 1582–1624) was an Indian Hindu painter in the Mughal style.Manohar's father Basawan was a master painter in the Mughal emperor's court, where Manohar grew up. His father most likely instructed him, and later Manohar became a court painter as well. His earliest works were painted for Akbar, and then later he was in the service of Akbar's son and successor Jahangir. Manohar's works frequently depicted the royal families and life at court. Some of his works can be found at the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum.
Manaku	Question: question: Who has been researching Manaku?	Ref: B. N. Goswamy	Pred: B. N. Goswamy	Context: Manaku of Guler or Manaku (c. 1700–1760) was an Indian painter from the Guler State, in modern-day Himachal Pradesh. After his death he was mostly forgotten and overshadowed by his much-celebrated younger brother Nainsukh. But today he is recognised as an exponent of Pahari style of painting, much like his brother. The rediscovery of Manaku has been a result of research efforts by art historians like B. N. Goswamy. Like Nainsukh, Manaku almost never signed his works, and only four extant works carry his signature.
Nainsukh	Question: question: Who was the younger son of Pandit Seu?	Ref: Nainsukh	Pred: Nainsukh	Context: Nainsukh (literally "Joy of the Eyes"; c. 1710 – 1778) was an Indian painter. He was the younger son of the painter Pandit Seu and, like his older brother Manaku of Guler, was an important practitioner of Pahari painting, and has been called "one of the most original and brilliant of Indian painters".Around 1740 he left the family workshop in Guler and moved to Jasrota, where he painted most of his works for the local Rajput ruler Mian Zorowar Singh and his son Balwant Singh until the latter's death in 1763. This is the best known and documented phase of his career.  Through his adaptation of elements of Mughal painting, he was a central force in the development of Pahari painting in the middle of the eighteenth century, bringing Mughal elements into what had been a school mainly concerned with Hindu religious subjects.  In his final phase at Basholi, from about 1765 until his death in 1778, Nainsukh returned to religious subject matter, but retaining his stylistic innovations.  By the end of his career, with an active family workshop continuing his style, he was probably not executing the works himself anymore, but leaving them to his children and nephew as his artistic heirs.  Such works are often ascribed to the Family of Nainsukh.According to B.N. Goswamy, the leading scholar of Nainsukh, "Devices and mannerisms associated with Nainsukh include: a preference for uncoloured grounds; shading through a light wash that imparts volume and weight to figures and groups; a fine horizontal line that separates ground from background; a rich green in which his landscapes are usually bathed; a bush with flat circular leaves that he often introduces; a peculiar loop of the long stem of a hooka; and a minor figure often introduced in a two-thirds profile."Although a great part of his work may be lost, around a hundred works by Nainsukh survive, many in both Indian and Western museums. Four of these bear his signature, and several have inscribed titles or comments.  Unusually for Pahari painting, some are dated. There are at least two self-portraits, one from early in his career, and the other in a group scene with Balwant Singh, who is looking at a miniature, with the artist seated below him. Nainsukh peers over the raja's shoulder, perhaps offering his comments on the work, or ready to do so.'Nainsukh, a film based on his life directed by Amit Dutta released in 2010. Dutta has also made the short documentary films Gita Govinda (2013), Field-Trip (2013), and Scenes from a Sketchbook (2016) which cover different aspects of the painter's work.

Sahibdin	Question: question: What era did Sahibdin's style continue?	Ref: Gujarati	Pred: Gujarati	Context: Sahibdin (fl. 17th century) was an Indian miniature painter of the Mewar school of Rajasthan painting. He was one of the dominant painters of the era, and one of the few whose name is still known today (another being the painter Manohar Das). Sahibdin was a Muslim, but that kept neither his Hindu patrons from employing him, nor him from composing Hindu-themed works of great value. Sahibdin's paintings deftly combine elements of the "popular Mughal" style then in vogue across northern India with the traditional Rajput style.Among his surviving works are a series of musically themed "Ragamala" from 1628; a series on the scriptural text Bhagavata Purana from 1648; and illustrations to the Yuddha Kanda, the sixth book of the Ramayana, from 1652. His style can be seen to continue the figure style of the Gujarati era, while also incorporating new elements, like mountainous terrains, from Mughal art.== References ==

Guo Xi	Question: question: What is one of Guo Xi's most famous paintings?	Ref: Early Spring	Pred: Early Spring	Context: Guo Xi (Chinese: 郭熙; pinyin: Guō Xī; Wade–Giles: Kuo Hsi) (c. 1020 – c. 1090) was a Chinese landscape painter from Henan Province who lived during the Northern Song dynasty. One text entitled "The Lofty Message of Forest and Streams" (Linquan Gaozhi 林泉高致) is attributed to him. The work covers a variety of themes centered on the appropriate way of painting a landscape. He was a court professional, a literatus, well-educated painter who developed an incredibly detailed system of idiomatic brushstrokes which became important for later painters. One of his most famous works is Early Spring, dated 1072. The work demonstrates his innovative techniques for producing multiple perspectives which he called "the angle of totality." This type of visual representation is also called "Floating Perspective", a technique which displaces the static eye of the viewer and highlights the differences between Chinese and Western modes of spatial representation.The following is an excerpt from his treatise, "mountains and waters":The clouds and the vapours of real landscapes are not the same at the four seasons. In spring they are light and diffused, in summer     rich and dense, in autumn scattered and thin, in winter dark and solitary. When such effects can be seen in pictures, the clouds and vapours have an air of life. The mist around the mountains is not the same at the four seasons. The mountains in spring are light and seductive as if smiling: the mountains in summer have a blue-green colour which seems to be spread over them; the mountains in autumn are bright and tidy as if freshly painted; the mountains in winter are sad and tranquil as if sleeping.Guo Xi was often referred to as a "Northern Song master" when it came to painting. His work inspired many later artists and he even had landscapes dedicated to him. His lesser-known "Deep Valley" scroll painting depicts a serene mountain valley covered with snow and several trees struggling to survive on precipitous cliffs. The ink washes and amorphous brush strokes are employed to model surfaces that suggest the veiling effects of the atmosphere. One of Guo Xi’s techniques was to layer ink washes to build up forms and his "Deep Valley" is a masterpiece of the use of light ink and magnificent composition.His son later described how Guo Xi approached his work: "On days when he was going to paint, he would seat himself at a clean table, by a bright window, burning incense to right and left. He would choose the finest brushes, the most exquisite ink; wash his hands, and clean the ink-stone, as though he were expecting a visitor of rank. He waited until his mind was calm and undisturbed, and then began."
